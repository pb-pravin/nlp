I'm Alice. Mary is my classmate and she is also my good friend. One day, we got our math test results. I did very badly so I didn't want to talk to anyone after class. But Mary said,“You look unhappy. What’s the matter?” I looked at her but said nothing. I knew she did well in the exam. I thought she might laugh at me. She kept asking,“Do you want me to show you the right answers?” I still kept silent. Then she went away with my paper. In the afternoon, Mary gave back my exam paper. To my surprise, she explained how to work out the problems on my paper. My face got red. How kind she was! I felt sorry, but I only said,“Thank you!”
