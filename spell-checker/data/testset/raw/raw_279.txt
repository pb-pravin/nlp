In Thailand, people do not eat with chopsticks like in Japan and Korea. They use spoons and forks. They never use knives. Most food is already cut. If you need cut things, use the side of your spoon first and then use your fork. If you are right-handed, keep the spoon in your right hand and the fork in your left hand. People usually have rice in different bowls. The rice is not on the same plate with other food. It is not necessary to finish all your food and it is good to leave a little on your plate. If you eat up something, it means you want more. People always offer more food. The host will ask you two or three times if you want more food. It is the same as the drinks. During the meal, never make your cup or glass empty. Always refill your neighbour's glass. This means that you must keep an eye on your neighbour's glass all through the meal.
