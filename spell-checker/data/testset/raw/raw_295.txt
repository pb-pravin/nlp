We live in Computer Age. Computers can help people do much of their work, such as playing games, listening to music, shopping and so on. But few people know how to take care of them. Please remember the following when you use your computer: 1.Keep your computer in a dry cool room. Too much heat is bad for computers. 2.Do not smoke near your computer. Smoking is also bad for them. 3.Do not drink or eat near computers. A little water and pieces of food in the keyboard are also bad for a computer. 4.Keep your screen clean and do not have it too bright. They are bad for your eyes. Make sure the screen is not too far or too near to your eyes when you use a computer.
