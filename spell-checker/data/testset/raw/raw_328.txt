Jeff is a Chinese teacher. He works very long hours every day. He gets up at 5 o'clock. He goes running at 5:15. That makes him&nbsp; keep fit . He reads books about history and art at 6:00 in the morning. He often says people should never stop learning. Breakfast starts at 6:30, and after that he goes to school on his old bike. He usually has three classes in the daytime and two in the evening. His students love him. They say Jeff is good with them and his class is interesting. Jeff eats his lunch and supper at school and gets home at about 8:30. He often watches TV or listens to music at home in the evening. After taking a shower at about 10:15, he goes to bed. Sometimes I ask him, "Do you like your job?" He says, "Yes! It's a good job. Students make me feel young and happy."
