We call Chinese New Year the Spring Festival. There is a name for each Chinese year. We may call it the year of the sheep, the year of the monkey or the tiger. Before New Year's Day, people are busy shopping and cleaning their houses. On New Year's Eve, there is a big family dinner. After dinner, all the families stay up late to welcome the New Year. On the first day of the New Year, people put on their new clothes and go to visit their friends. They say "Good luck" and some other greetings to each other. People usually have a very good time during the festival.
