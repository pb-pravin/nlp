Many people are talking about if we should learn traditional characters now. Here come some students' different ideas. Zhang Cha, 14, from Shanghai: I think traditional characters are a great part of Chinese culture . We should keep them. And it is also interesting to learn. Many traditional characters are pictograms . We see the character, and we know what it means. Zhong Zeming, 15, from Jiangsu: I think not all old things are good. We do not often study traditional characters, because it is hard to remember and write. I think we should go on studying simplified characters . It is easy to learn and write. In today's world, people don't use traditional characters very often. Liu Yiming, 14, from Beijing: Traditional characters are really hard to learn. That's why we use simplified characters. Now we students have to learn more. It is easy and fast to learn as many words as possible if we learn simplified characters. And now, many foreigners are also studying Chinese. Simplified characters are also easier for them. Wang Qing, 15, from Zhejiang: Traditional characters are interesting. And many Chinese people in Hong Kong, Taiwan and many other places are still using them. If we don't pay any attention to traditional characters, communicating with people there may cause some problems. So I think we should also learn traditional characters. It is good for all Chinese people in the world to communicate with each other.
