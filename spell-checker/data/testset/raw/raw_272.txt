Dear Jimmy, Something terrible happened to me several days ago. When I wake up in the morning, I often take a shower and then have a sandwich and a cup of coffee for breakfast before I go to class. But that morning was different. It was on June 24. The alarm clock didn't work, so I got up late. It was about time for me to go to class. I had to do everything quickly. I didn't have enough time to do the things as usual. I went straight to my school, but later I remembered that I forgot to turn off the gas in the kitchen. I asked my teacher for permission to go back to my house by taxi. When I got home, I saw much smoke all around. I ran quickly to turn off the gas. If I came back a bit late, nothing would be left. I was really frightened. From then on, I woke up early to get everything ready before I went out of my home. You should also check everything before you leave your house. Take care! Yours, Bruce
