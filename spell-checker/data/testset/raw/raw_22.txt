In Britain you’re allowed to drive a car when you’re seventeen. You have to get a special two-year driving license before you can start. When you’re learning, someone with a full license always has to be in the car with you because you aren't allowed to drive the car on the road alone. You don’t have to go to a driving school — a friend can teach you. The person with you isn’t allowed to take money for the lesson unless he’s got a teacher’s license. Before you’re allowed to have a full license, you have to take a driving test. You can take a test in your own car, but it has to be fit for the road, the test you have to drive around for about half an hour and then answer a few questions. If you don’t pass the test，you’re allowed to take it again a few weeks later if you want to.
