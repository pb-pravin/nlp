Survey: What's your favorite restaurant? Lola Lopez "I'm an actress. There's a small French restaurant near my apartment. It's my favorite. The service is great. The food is always cooked well and severed beautifully. And the atmosphere is very romantic…" Jim Janssen "I'm a high school student. I'm interested in fast food. Chicken, hamburgers, fish, French fries— I love it all. My mum says I should eat healthier food but it tastes so good! Also, I'm not rich and the price of the fast food is just right for me." Gina Mangino "I'm a housewife. With three kids, I look for a place that has good food at a reasonable price. I look for a place that's comfortable for children and serves the food quickly. That's why I like Sam's Chinese Restaurant." Raul Sanchez "I'm a doctor. I can't remember the last time I ate out… maybe that's because my wife and I really like to cook. Instead of eating out, we look through a cookbook and cook at home."
