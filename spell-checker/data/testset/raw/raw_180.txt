Last Sunday evening my parents went for a walk with my sister. But I studied alone at home because I would have an English test. Suddenly, I saw bright light in my neighbor's kitchen. I thought he was cooking so I went on studying. Soon, there was a terrible smell in the air and I thought something was wrong. I went out and saw fire coming out of my neighbor's kitchen. So I shouted "Fire! Fire!" But no one heard or came out. I ran quickly into my house to call 119, and then I rang my neighbor's doorbell and knocked at the door, but there was no response . I got into the house through the window and found my neighbor sleeping in his bedroom. I woke him up and we rushed out of the house together. We tried our best to pour water through the kitchen window, but the fire was too heavy. Luckily, the firemen came and put out the fire quickly. When my parents came back, they found I was dirty and tired. After my neighbor told them the whole story, they were happy and said I was a brave boy.
