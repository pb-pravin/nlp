Tom was from Canada and he has come to New York for a holiday. One day he was not feeling well, so he asked a man of his hotel to find a doctor. The man said, "Thomas Brown is a good doctor." Tom said, "Thank you very much. Is he expensive?" "Well," the man answered. "He always asks his patients for two dollars if they are first visit. One dollar if they are later visit." Tom decided to save one dollar. So when he went to see the doctor, he said, "I've come again, doctor." For a few minutes the doctor looked at his face carefully without saying anything. Then he said, "Everything's going as it should do. Oh, I gave you medicine last time, didn't I? Just go on with it."
