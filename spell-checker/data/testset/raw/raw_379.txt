“Hurry up, Dad! Jane and I are ready,” Harry called out. “I will be late if I drive you to school,” Mr. Smith said. “Can't you go to school on foot this morning?” “But our school is far away!” Jane said. “Walking is a good way to keep healthy, children. Now get your schoolbags and go!” So Jane and Harry had to walk five blocks to school finally. In the evening, the children told their grandpa that they walked to school that morning. Grandpa said, “That was good for you. When I was young, I walked five kilometers to school every day.” Jane said, “But I hate walking.” Grandpa said, “Children should walk and run every day. If you do so , you will become stronger and stronger. You won't get sick so often.” “From now on I'll walk to school every day,” Harry said. “I'd like to be healthy and strong.” “I will join you, Harry,” Jane said happily.
