A very strict officer was talking to some new soldiers and he had to train them. He had never seen them before, so he began, "My name is Stone, and I'm even harder than stone, so do what I tell you, or there'll be trouble, "Then he went to each soldier and asked him his name. "Speak aloud so that everyone can hear you clearly, "he said."Don't forget to call me sir, "Each soldier told him his name, until he came to the last one. This man kept silent and Captain Stone shouted at him, "When I ask you a question, answer it. I'll ask you again. What's your name, soldier? " "My name is Stonebreaker, sir." He said nervously.
