Years ago, I lived in a building in a large city. The building next door was only a few feet away from mine. There was a woman who lived there and whom I had never met, yet I could see her sitting by her window each afternoon, sewing or reading. After several months had gone by, I began to notice that her window was dirty. Everything was unclear through the dirty window. I would say to myself, "Why doesn't clean her window? It really looks terrible." One bright morning I decided to clean my flat, including washing the window. Late in the afternoon when I finished the cleaning, I sat down by the window with a cup of coffee for a rest. What a surprise! The woman sitting by her window was clearly seen. Her window was clean! Then it dawned on me . I had been criticizing her dirty window, but all the time I was watching hers through my own dirty window. That was quite an important lesson for me. How often had I looked at and criticized others through the dirty window of my heart, through my own shortcomings ? From then on, whenever I wanted to judge someone, I asked myself first, "Am I looking at him through my own dirty window?" Then I try to clean the window of my own world so that I can see others' world more clearly.
