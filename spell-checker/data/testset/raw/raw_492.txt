Riding horse is a traditional Chinese skill. In ancient times, Chinese people were used to riding on the road. Carriages and horses were very convenient and important for them to travel. Old Chinese people enjoy firing arrows on the horses' backs. In addition, horses were widely used in the army. There were two kinds of soldiers at that time. One was called the cavalry and the other was called the infantry . The cavalry was much more powerful than the infantry. Almost every war in Chinese history couldn't be without horses. However, we can hardly see horses around us now. We always see them in films or zoos. What makes this happen? With the development of science and technology and the invention of the new things, horses have become useless. Most of the horses around us even can't run today. Some of them are only used for amusement. Are you happy to see this? I'm afraid I'm not.
