If you want to have a really quiet holiday, you must go and stay on a farm. Last year we went to my brother's farm and enjoyed ourselves very much. But the farmer's life is not an easy one. There's always much work to do. He must look after his horses; he must milk the cows. Then he has to take good care of the young animals. He must raise cocks and hens, ducks and turkeys for the market. We all like to have a turkey for Christmas, don't we? In the old days most of the work on a farm was done by hand and with the help of horses, but now things are different. Most of the farm work is done by machine. When we stay at my brother's farm, we have to work very hard, but don't mind, we really enjoy it, if the weather is nice.
