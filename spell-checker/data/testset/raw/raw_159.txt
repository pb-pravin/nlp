Once a great boxer , Tom Brown, went to a restaurant for dinner. He put his bag near the door, but he was afraid that someone would take it. So he got out a pen and a piece of paper and wrote on it: "The great boxer, Tom Brown, left his bag here. He will come back in a few minutes." He put the paper on his bag and went to have his dinner. When he came hack, his bag wasn't there. But he found a piece of paper on the ground. It said: "A great runner took away your bag, and he will not come back."
