Where to eat There are a number of different places to eat in the shopping centre. The Noodle House is small, but very popular. The noodle soup tastes very good, and the fried noodles with roast pork are delicious. Everything is clean and the staffs are friendly. Prices are good, too, but you may have to wait quite a long time as the restaurant is so busy. Roma is a new restaurant. It is very clean, but the pizzas there do not taste good. We didn't eat our fish as it smelles bad. The waiters looked angry and we thought it was very expensive. This restaurant has to improve. The Tokyo Restaurant has been here for many years, and the staffs bow to cumstomers when they enter and are very kind. The fish is very fresh and most of the food is delicious. The amount of food you get is quite small, but it always looks nice on the plate. The Golden Dragon is a large Chinese restaurant. It has a lot of different foods. The sweet and sour pork is excellent, the Beijing Duck is famous, and the soup is good. Go there for a really good meal, but expect to pay a lot. Prices are high. The Come in Coffee Shop is very modern. There are many sorts of coffee. And if you like sweet things, wait until you taste their cakes and cookies! You can also have sandwiches a lot. They have modern music playing, but it is very noisy. So it is quite difficult to have a conversation.
