For many families, summer is a good time to go on a trip. Children do not go to school in July or August. So they are free to go out with their parents. Some families go on a picnic . They usually take their favorite food to eat at a beautiful place. Some people enjoy traveling to some interesting places by car or by train. If they have enough time and money, they even travel to some busy and modern cities in other countries, like Paris, New York and Sydney. They usually go to these cities by plane. But not everyone likes busy cities. Some families like getting close to nature. They choose to climb mountains.
