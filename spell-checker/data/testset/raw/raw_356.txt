If you go to visit London, you’ll see a lot of buses and cars on the road. You’ll also see many bikes because more and more people travel by bike. Why? There are many reasons. First, it is very cheap to buy a bike, and it is quick, too. You often need to wait for a bus for half an hour. When the bus comes, there are so many other buses and cars on the roads that the bus moves very slowly. I travelled to work by bus for about four years. I often arrived at work late and felt tired. Then one day, about two years ago, a friend of mine said, “I go to work by bike. Why don't we travel together?” “But my bike is old, and there are so many buses and cars on the roads. I’ll feel frightened,” I answered. “Don’t be afraid. If you follow me and we ride slow1y, you’ll be fine,” he said. Later, I bought a new bike. We went slowly, but we arrived at work quickly. I spent 40 minutes going by bus, but only half an hour by bike! Now I love riding a bike. And I feel healthy. Many people think my idea is good and maybe you’ll see more bikes on the road in the future.
