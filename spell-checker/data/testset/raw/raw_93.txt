When I was a child, I love to read stories. I wanted to read all the time. I like exciting stories about animals and brave children who helped police officers get the thief. I liked to read my novels at night. When my family were in bed, I began to read. Sometimes the story was sad and I felt unhappy. Sometimes it was happy and I felt happy, too. Other stories were scary. I liked them all! Sometimes I read my novels until very late and my eyes became very tired. My eyes got worse because I didn't use enough light to read. My mother took me to see an eye doctor. The doctor gave me a prescription. He told me to wear a pair of glasses. He said to me, "The later you wait, the worse your eyes may get. Don't worry if you need glasses, you can get popular ones, so you will look good." Reading is fun, but remember to use enough light when you read.
