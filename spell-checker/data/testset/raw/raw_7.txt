On the second floor of the library, we have a large reading room. Many students come here after class every day. Some even come during lunch time. There are a number of rules for using the reading room. First, you should put the books back to the places where you take them. The magazines and newspapers are on different shelves. Remember to leave them where you find them after you have finished reading. Put everything in good order. You are not expected to talk loudly here. So keep quiet for others and you will find it a good place to read.
