Curly is my big black dog. He is very strong and he often carries me on his back. He likes to run and play with me. He likes to follow my father around in the fields, too. One day, in the fields my father takes off his coat and puts it on the ground under a big tree. Curly stands there and watches him. My father says,"Watch my coat, Curly." Curly sits down on the coat. In the afternoon, my father forgets all about his coat and goes home without it. Later in the evening I miss my dog. So I look for him everywhere, calling."Curly! Curly!"But Curly doesn't come back. Later my father wants something in his pocket. Then he remembers where his coat is. He goes back to the big tree. What do you think he sees? Curly is sitting on the coat so that nobody can take it away.
