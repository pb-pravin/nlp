A history teacher was talking to his class about the ancient Romans. "They were very strong, brave people, and they were good soldiers, too." he said."They always wanted to have strong bodies, so they played a lot of games." "Did they like swimming?" one of the girls asked. "That makes people strong." She was very good at swimming. "Oh, yes, some of them swam a lot," the teacher answered. Then he told them a story about a famous Roman. "There was a big, wide river in the middle of Rome," he said, "and one man swam across it three times every day before breakfast!" The girl laughed when she heard this. "Why are you laughing?" the teacher asked her angrily. "Did I say something interesting?" "Well, sir," the girl answered, "Why didn't he swim across the river four times to get back his clothes back?"
