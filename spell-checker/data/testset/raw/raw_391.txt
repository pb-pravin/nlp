B On a small farm in Mexico, there are no schools. A bus is the school! The driver of the bus is the teacher! It is a school bus, but it doesn't take children to school. It just goes round from place to place, and sometimes it comes to this farm. The bus will stay here for three months. The farmers call it a school on wheels . In the morning, the bus comes to the farm, and the teacher teaches the children aged from eight to ten. In the afternoon, the children aged from eleven to fifteen come to have their lessons because they have to work in the morning. At night, the fathers and mothers come to have their lessons. They all like the school bus, but all the people on the farm hope they can have a real school some day.
