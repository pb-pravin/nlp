B In my family, there are my parents, my grandparents, my brother and I. We have a happy life. My father is a teacher. He works in a school. He gets up early and works very hard every day. Sometimes he helps me with my homework. His students love him very much because he likes to help them. My mother is a writer. She doesn't need to go to work but she writes books, cleans the house and takes care of us. My grandparents are old. They don't have jobs. They are at home every day, reading newspapers and watching TV. They go to bed early. My brother is a student. He is in my school, too. He likes playing basketball, tennis and ping-pong. I like to play soccer, ping-pong and computer games. After school, we get home early. We do our homework, play sports and help our parents in the evening.
