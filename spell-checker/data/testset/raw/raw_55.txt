My brother, Gary, has an excellent job at a bank. I couldn't believe him when he told me that he had decided to give it up. I tried to make him change his mind, I failed. "You shouldn't do that," I said. "You have already spent six years in the bank and you could have a wonderful future. You could become a bank manager when you are 30. "Maybe,"Gary said. "I think the job in the bank is OK. It’s a pleasant job in a pleasant environment. The bank manager told me that my future was bright." "Then why do you want to leave?" I shouted in surprise. "It’s the money," Gary said. "But your salary is good. You’ve got enough money. " I said. "I don’t mean that," Gary said, "What do I do at the bank? Well, all I do is to count money. I find it very boring and sad. "Is it sad to count money?" I asked and didn't know why he said so. "You don't understand," Gary said, "I enjoy counting my own money, but I hate counting others' money."
