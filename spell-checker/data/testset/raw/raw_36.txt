M: OK, I'm taking you all to the park. But there are rules, and everyone must understand what you can do before we go. Is that clear? Well, we can all go on our bicycles, bccause bikes are allowed in the park. But you mustn't go swimming in the lake-it's against the rules, and it's dangerous. You can take a football if you like-there are lots of places where you can play football in the park. You can only listen to music on your MP. You mustn't use a normal radio or a recorder, because it disturbs people. You can buy things to eat there like ice creamï¼Œbut you mustn't leave litter. That's the most important thing. So please remember, don't drop litter. Well, that's it, I think. I've told you the rules. Oh yes, and there's another thing-there are lots of beautiful flowers in the park, but you mustn't pick them. Leave them where they are. Is that clear?
