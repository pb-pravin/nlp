Many Chinese people like American country music, for example, the songs of John Denver. But some people still don't know when country music began. Country music is from the folk music of the Appalachian Mountains in the east of America. There, people sang while playing the violin and guitar. They sang about everyday life, love and their problems. So the songs were sometimes a little sad. One of the most popular country music singers is John Denver. He is also very famous to the Chinese. For Denver, music was a language that could bring the world together. He said music can bring people together. We will understand each other better through music. People are different in colours and they may speak different languages, but people are the same in mind and body. All of them love music and can understand music. The world lost a great man when John Denver died in 1997. But his music and words will live on.
