The middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. Tell you the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work in an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. Do more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is the Bird-Loving Month in China. You should join it! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. Have you ever quarrelled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Be friendly to the people you with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new idea makes life better. Protect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. Use the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But something on the Internet isn't good for kids, so try to look at webpages that are good for you.
