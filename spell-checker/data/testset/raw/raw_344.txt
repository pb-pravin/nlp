Last Sunday evening, my parents went out for a walk with my sister. But I studied alone at home because I would have an English test. Suddenly, I saw bright light in my neighbour's kitchen. I thought he was cooking, so I went on studying. Soon, there was a terrible smell in the air and I thought something was wrong. I went out and saw fire coming out of my neighbour's kitchen. So I shouted"Fire, Fire!"But no one heard or came out. I ran quickly to my house to call 119, and then I rang my neighbour's doorbell, knocked at the door, but there was no response . I got into the house through the window and found my neighbor sleeping in his bedroom. I woke him up and we rushed out of the house together. We tried our best to pour water through the kitchen window, but the fire was too strong. Luckily, the firemen came and put out the fire quickly. When my parent came back, they found I was dirty and tired. After my neighbour told them the whole story, they were happy and said I was a brave boy.
