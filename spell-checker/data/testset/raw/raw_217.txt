Fast food chains , American-style, are now on the increase all over the world. Most of these places work on a similar principle. There is a long counter , above which hangs a list of the items they sell, and behind which several people are working. Buyers from queues in front of each assistant. You receive what you order and take it on a tray to a table. If you can't see any straws , that’s because they are hiding in the straw machine that you have to push the bottom to get a straw. When you’ve finished, you yourself throw away everything except the tray. Many fast-food places have drive-in facilities . You place your order from your car through a microphone and then drive round to a special window to pay and pick it up. You may even find places where a waitress brings your meal out, and you sit and eat in the car from a tray hooked over the door through the open window.
