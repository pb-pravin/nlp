My name is Anna. Last Saturday, my parents and I went to Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. It is a national park in China. The park is 480 thousand square meters. It's in Hunan Province. It is 28 kilometers from Wulingyuan Scenic and Historic Interest Area. It's a very beautiful park. There are many kinds of rare trees, plants and animals in the park. The ticket price for adults is 258 yuan. With this ticket, you can visit all the places in the park as well as take the table car and the bus in the park. For students, it's half price. My parents think that it's a wonderful place, although the price is a bit high.
