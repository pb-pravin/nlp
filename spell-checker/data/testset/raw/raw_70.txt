Language changes with time and the world, and so does English. New words are borrowed form other languages. About 900 years ago there were great changes in England. A great many words were borrowed into English from French. About 500 years ago there was another great change. This time it was a change in pronunciation, but the spelling was not much changed. English words are spelled quite the same as they were in those days. The spelling showed how words spoken at that time. It does not tell us much about the pronunciation of words today. For example, the letters "gh" in the word "night" show us nothing about how it is spoken now. That's why students of English find English spelling so confusing.
