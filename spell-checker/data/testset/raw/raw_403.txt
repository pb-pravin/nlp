Why should we have good table manners? They make eating more pleasant. None of us, for example, really want to watch another person chew food with his or her mouth open. So here are a few easy rules to get you through any meal without displeasing your table mates. 1. Put your napkin in your lap as soon as you sit down and leave it beside your plate when you have finished eating. 2. Sit up straight. It will help you digest your food, and it's polite. 3. When you are a guest, take a small part of everything that is served. Your parents may not expect you to eat something you don't like, but others will expect you to take a small part. No one will say anything if you don't finish it. 4. Use your napkin on your mouth after eating solid food and before drinking liquids. 5. Say “Please” and “Thank you” when asking someone to pass you something. Pass food without delay to others. 6. Don't chew food with your mouth open. This also means talking with your mouth full. 7. Don't say that you hate a certain food. Someone worked hard to prepare it and didn't like hearing this. 8. Don't wave your eating utensils around when you are eating or are resting between bites. Put them on your plate. 9. Cut food into small pieces, one piece at a time. Only babies have their food cut up at once-and their parents only do that to save time. 10. Ask to be excused when you are ready to leave the table.
