Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am your tourist guide. First, I'd like to say "Welcome to Beijing." As you all know, Beijing is the capital of China. It is in North China. It is one of the largest cities in the world. It has a population of about 12 million. Beijing is famous for its places of historic interest and traditional food. There are many attractive places here: the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, Tianâ€™anmen Square and so on. Now we are on the way to the Forbidden City, the centre of Beijing. Hope you enjoy your trip here.
