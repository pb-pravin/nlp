M: Hello, I'm Harvard Smith. As the editor of The Voice, I'd like to introduce you to our school newspaper. We need volunteers to help us. Experience isn't necessary. We need people with writing skills. The newspaper comes out four days a week, from Monday to Thursday. So we need excellent students who know how to plan their time well. We can pay you, but this isn't something you do for the money. Mostly it's just for fun. Anyone who is interested in this job should speak to me right after this meeting. My telephone number is 1812487663. Thank you very much.
