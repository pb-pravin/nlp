If you go to Hong Kong, you will find the beautiful Ocean Park. The largest sky roller in Asia is in it. There is also a swimming centre called Water World in the park. Every year, many tourists go there for fun. If you have the chance to go to Mongkok in Kowloon, you will see the "Women's Street". But it is not a street just for women. A lot of people go there for cheap clothes. The famous Temple Street is also in Mongkok. You can find many snack shops there. Though they are all delicious, be careful with your stomach!
