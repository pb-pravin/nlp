English people have porridge for breakfast, too. But their porridge is made of oats , not rice. Many English people put sugar in their porridge, but the Scottish always put salt in it. English people always drink tea out of cups, not out of glasses. They usually drink tea with sugar and milk. When you go to an English family for tea, the host or hostess always asks you, "How many lumps of sugar do you want in your tea?" In ordinary English families, the main meal is in the evening, because most of the families are away during the day. But on Sundays when everybody is at home, they make the midday meal, and in the evening they have a much lighter supper.
