When the shopkeeper gave her the apples, she counted them. "Why, I have got fewer than Mother," she said, "She also paid you ten pennies for apples yesterday." "It's quite right," answered the shopkeeper patiently. "Don't you understand if you get fewer apples, you'll have to carry the less." "Well," Mary thought for a while. She put nine pennies on the counter and left. "Come back," cried the shopkeeper, "You haven't paid me enough money yet." "That's quite all right," Mary said patiently, "Don't you understand if you get fewer pennies, you'll have to count the less."
