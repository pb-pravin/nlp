Since Roman times, ostriches have been said to be so stupid that they react to danger by burying their heads in the sand. This belief caused the popular phrase to be born: play the ostrich. It is often used to describe people who refuse to face painful facts. They prefer to ignore the truth. It is like children sticking their fingers in their ears and crying: "I can't hear you!" But do ostriches really bury their heads in the sand when they are in danger? The answer is no for sure! Although ostriches can't fly, they can run as fast as 40 miles per hour. So, if they find themselves in danger, they will just run very fast.
