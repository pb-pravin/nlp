Some people are pessimistic when they think about the future. They say that, a hundred years from now, we will have used up most of the Earth's resources. We will have polluted our seas badly, and be unable to eat fish from them. We will have made the air so dirty that we will need to wear masks. The world's population will have doubled, and we will have used all the countryside for housing; there will be no farmland left. Other people have a different idea about the future. In their view, the city of the future will be a huge pyramid-shaped building, which will be floating on the surface of the sea. About 5,000 families will live there, and there will also be schools, shops in it. In a hundred years' time, people will not need to use oil. They will heat their homes with power from the sun. Think of space. Perhaps a station will be set up on the moon; people will be able to visit the moon as tourists. They may even spend their holidays in space, travelling from planet to planet. What an interesting picture! Many people don't think about the future. "I don't care. I'll be dead. "they say. But it is our duty to care because the world of a hundred years' time will be the world of our children's and their children after them.
