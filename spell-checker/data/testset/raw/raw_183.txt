My cousin Bill likes going to the beach on Sunday. Last Sunday it was sunny, he went there with his brother. They got there at 9:00. There were lots of people there on vacation. Bill and his brother sat down and began to relax. Soon Bill found there were lots of empty water bottles on the beach. He also saw some paper bags on the beach. That made Bill sad. He and his brother began to work to clean the beach. They worked hard. About two hours later, the beach was clean again. At last they put up a sign, saying, "No Littering" on the beach. They wanted people to keep the beach clean. After that, they were very hungry. So they went to a restaurant nearby to have lunch. They had two large bowls of beef noodles there, and then went home.
