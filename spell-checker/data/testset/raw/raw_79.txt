Let me tell you something about the Mid-­Autumn Day. August 15th in Chinese lunar calendar is the Mid-­Autumn Day. It's one of the most important traditional festivals in China. On that day people usually go back home to have a family reunion. Each family member will get together to have a big dinner. The most popular food is moon cakes. They are round and look like the moon. The moon is the brightest that night. People eat the delicious food while they are enjoying a beautiful full moon in their yard. At this time, some old people would like to tell many past events and tell the children a story about the rabbit. The children really believe that there is a rabbit on the moon. They want to go to the moon and have a look one day. What a great festival!
