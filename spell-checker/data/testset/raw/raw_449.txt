Once a great lion was sleeping in a forest. A little mouse happened to come and ran over his face. The lion woke up and caught the little mouse very angrily. He was going to eat her. "Oh, dear kind lion!" Said the little mouse. "Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do you any harm . Let me go, I shall pay back your kindness and help you. " "Ha,ha,ha," laughed the lion, "How can a little thing like you help a great lion? But I'm not hungry now, you can go." "Thank you very much, kind lion! I hope I shall be able to help you some day." Said the little mouse. Some time after this, the lion was caught in a trap. Just then the little mouse came along and heard "help" from the lion. She began to look for the lion and found him, she ran down to the lion, and said, "You were very kind to me once. Now I'll save your life and repay you the kindness which you showed me the other day. " Soon she cut the ropes of the trap with her sharp teeth, and the lion was happy to be free again. "Thank you, little mouse!" Said the lion, and then they walked away happily.
