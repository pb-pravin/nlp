One day an old woman wants to go to London to see her son. She gets up early and reaches the small station at nine o'clock in the morning. Because this is her first trip to London, she doesn't know the train time. She is very worried. Just then, she sees a little boy running to her. She stops him and asks him what time the train comes and leaves for London. The boy looks at the woman and says, "tu:tu:tu:tu:tu"ï¼Œjust like firing a gun .Then he runs away. The old woman is surprised and gets very angry. She wants to know why the boy plays a joke on her. She sits in a chair and thinks and thinks, then she begins to smile. She says, "What a clever boy! He tells me the time in such a way."Do you know the time?
