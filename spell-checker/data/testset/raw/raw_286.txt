When it wants to drink, it puts its trunk into the water. lt lifts its trunk and then blows the water into its mouth. Elephants also use their tusks and trunks to lift heavy logs of wood. In some countries men catch wild elephants and teach them to work for them. All day long they work in the hot sun. They pull trees along and lift heavy logs. No animals are stronger than elephants. Wild elephants usually stay together in the big families. Usually they move about at night, and look for food. In the hot daytime, they go to sleep under trees. Elephants are kind animals. When one of them is hurt and cannot pull itself on to its feet, the other elephants lift it up and help it to work.
