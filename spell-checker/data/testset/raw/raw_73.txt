One day when Jack was walking in the park, he saw a woman he knew sitting on a bench with a dog beside her. The dog was looking up at the woman. Jack walked up to the woman and said. "Hello，Sue, how are you? May I sit and talk with you for a while?" "Of course, please sit down." Sue said. Jack sat down next to Sue on the bench, and they talked quietly together. The dog continued to look up at Sue. as if waiting for her to feed him. "That's a nice dog." Jack said, pointing at the animal. "Yes, he's handsome. He's a bit of a mixture, but that's not a bad thing. He's strong and healthy." "And hungry," Jack said. "He hasn't taken his eyes off you. He thinks you've got some food for him." "That's true." Sue said. "But I haven't." The two friends laughed and then Jack said, "Does your dog bite?" "No." Sue said. "He's never bitten anyone. He's always gentle and good-tempered." Hearing this. Jack decided to touch the dog. He put out his hand and touched the animal's head. Immediately it jumped up and bit him. "Hey!" Jack shouted. "You said your dog didn't bite." Sue answered，"That's not my dog. Mine is at home."
