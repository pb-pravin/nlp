Boys and girls, We will have a picnic in Happy Town on Thursday the 24th&nbsp;of&nbsp;September.&nbsp;I'd like to invite your parents to&nbsp;join&nbsp;us. You can come with your parents at seven forty on Thursday morning. You need to bring some food and drinks. We will&nbsp;go to Happy Town by school bus at&nbsp;eight thirty in the morning and we will get there at about nine forty. First, we will play on the beach. You can play volleyball or other ball games, but you mustn't swim in&nbsp;the sea. Next, we will have lunch at about twelve thirty. You can share your food during the picnic. Then,&nbsp;you will help clean up the beach. After that, we will walk around the village in Happy Town and look at some old houses there. We will leave Happy Town at about two o'clock in the afternoon. You don't need to come to&nbsp;school on Friday. You&nbsp;can have a holiday on that day.
