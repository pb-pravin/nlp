Tom didn't live too far from school. So he went there and came back on foot every day. On his way to school he passed a wet playground when it rained. One day the boy came home very wet. His mother became angry and said, "Don't play in the water on your way home or to school." The next day he came home very wet again. His mother became even angrier. "I'll tell your father if you come home wet again." She said, "Then he'll punish you." The next day the young boy was dry when he came home from school. "You were a good boy today," his mother said, "you didn't play in the water." "No," he answered sadly, "There were so many older boys in the water when I got there this afternoon that there wasn't any room for me at all."
