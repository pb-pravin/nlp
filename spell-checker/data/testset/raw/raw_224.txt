If you dream of becoming a spaceman after you grow up, get started now! A spaceman needs a strong body and mind. See here what Shenzhou IX spacemen are able to do. Don't you still have a long way to go? Shenzhou IX spacemen are able to live upside down . They do this not just during sleep, but also when eating and going to the toilet. Before they flew into space, they had lots of practice. Each upside-down training time lasted for 20 days. In Shenzhou IX, Chinese spacemen aren't just spaceship drivers but also machine repairers and scientists. They have to know every part of the spaceship and how it works. If something goes wrong, they must know how to repair it. Also they do scientific experiments in space. Shenzhou IX spacemen know how to live in the wild. They took a knife, a gun and some dye with them into space. If they land in forests, the knife and gun can protect them from wild animals. If they fall into the sea, the dye can colour the sea water around them yellow. T his can help people find them easily on the sea. Shenzhou IX spacemen can't get dizzy . A spaceship is not a plane. When it goes up, the extra gravity force can break people's bones. Spacemen must have strong bodies for this. They can't get a headache or be sick. With many things to take care of, they've got no time for sickness.
