Hi, everyone! I'm Tom. I'm very glad to be here with you. I'm a news reporter from England. It's the first time for me to visit China. I've looked around the city of Beijing. I've visited some schools, hospitals and &nbsp;talked with the teachers, students and doctors. All these have helped me to know China better than before. I'm now writing a report about Beijing. In the report, I'll tell my English listeners what I have seen and heard in China. I think my report will help the English people to know more about China and Chinese people. It can also help to improve the friendship between England and China.
