Hello, everyone! I am Kate. Let me tell you something about our plan for you. I think you will have a good time here. This afternoon, we will go together on a walking tour of the city. Then on Tuesday afternoon, we are going to the sports center where you can play football, table tennis or go swimming to keep yourselves fit. On Wednesday afternoon, we will go to see a film. This week's film is Rio 2. On Thursday, we are going on a day trip to Brazil, and we are leaving here at 8:30 in the morning. Please don't be late, or we will go without you. Finally on Sunday morning, we are off to Urca Mountain, leaving at 7:30. If there is any thing else you would like to do while you are here, just ask me. I will help you.
