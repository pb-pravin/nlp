There was a man who had worked all of his life and had saved all of his money. He loved money more than anything else. And just before he died, he said to his wife: "Now listen, when I die, I want you to take all my money and put it in the casket with me. I want to take my money to the afterlife ." Well, one day he died. When they finished the ceremony , just before the undertakers closed the casket, the wife said: "Wait just a minute!" She came over with a box and put it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked it down. Her friend said: "I hope you werenâ€™t crazy enough to put all that money in the casket." She said: "Yes, I promised him that I was going to put that money in that casket with him." "You mean that you put all his money in the casket?" "I sure did," said the wife, "I got it all together, put it into my account and I wrote him a check ."
