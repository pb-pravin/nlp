Do you like writing travel stories? If you do, you'd better keep the following in mind when you write your travel stories. Memory: Don't trust your memory. When you return to write about your travel stories, you are sure to forget something. Make notes, take pictures, if you can, orally record what you see. Notes: Keep a small notebook and record what you see. You can write about what you see and write it in your personal style without missing anything. Picture: Pictures are very useful for you to recall what you saw. You can tell about your experiences simply by recalling what you felt when you took the pictures. Stories: When you are writing about your travel stories, make sure it is not too short as your readers may not get your full story and make sure it is not too long that the readers get bored. Popular factors: Make sure there are some popular factors in your articles so that the readers find your travel stories not only enjoyable to read, but also useful as well. Popular factors are the food, places to eat, places to stay while travelling in a strange land, how to keep from making mistakes in their travel, how to find what to do about the things you missed or wished you did.
