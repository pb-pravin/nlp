An Englishman goes to work in Japan. He can't speak much Japanese. One day he goes into a small restaurant to have lunch. He knows the Japanese word "egg", so he gets some eggs to eat. The restaurant is famous for its mushrooms. The Englishman wants to eat some mushrooms and tells the waiter about this in English. But the waiter doesn't know English at all, so he can't help the Englishman. The man thinks for a few minutes, then he takes out a pen and draws a picture of a mushroom carefully. The waiter looks at the picture for a long time, then he leaves. A few minutes later, he comes back with a large umbrella and gives it to the Englishman.
