We have always been interested in the Moon. 2,000 years ago people already knew it moved around the Earth and where it would be in the sky at different times of the year. At that time, everything about the Moon was learned by watching it carefully in the sky. When scientists could use telescopes to study the Moon more closely, their ideas began to change. They could see the Moon was made of rocks . Most scientists thought Moon rocks would be different from those on the Earth. This was because they believed the Moon was a planet that was caught by the Earth's gravity millions of years earlier. In 1969, Moon rocks were finally brought to the Earth and studied. Much to their surprise, scientists found the Moon and the Earth were made of the same things. But there was no water on the Moon. Once again we needed new ideas for this new information. After years of study, most scientists now think that the Moon was once part of the Earth. They believe very early in its history, maybe 4 million years ago, something about the size of Mars hit the Earth. This sent billions of rocks into space around our planet. These rocks slowly joined together and after many years became the Moon. In the future, even though our ideas about the Moon may change again, we will still be interested in it.
