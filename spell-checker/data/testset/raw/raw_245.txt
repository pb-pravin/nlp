Hi , I'm Ross and live in Washington D.C. Do you know that Washington is the capital of the USA ? New York is bigger and more famous , but Washington is still the capital ! I like Washington because there's so much to see and do. I think that you can find some of the most interesting places in America here. For example , the White House is here. That's the most famous home in America ! We also have the Library of Congress , the biggest library in the world. My favorite subjects are computer science and history. I get a lot of homework , but when I have free time , I enjoy reading thrillers and watching TV. On weekends I spend time with my family. We often go for walks in one of the largest city parks. I also play football with my friends , or just go to the mall and hang out . When I leave school , I plan to study history. One day , I want to become the president and live in the White House.
