Hello, everyone. I’m Jane, the hostess of Music Line. Now I’m going to tell you a little about a famous singer Edward. Edward lived in a town. He went through an unhappy childhood. His father died when he was two. His mother couldn’t feed him and left him at a dustbin. An old woman found him and took him home. She often went to pick something useful in the dustbin with him. And the boy had to depend on her. One day, when he was nine, the old woman was knocked down by a car while she was crossing the street. She was taken to a hospital at once and the doctors saved her. And she was paid ,000 pounds for the accident. She sent Edward to school. He had been in school only for five years before the old woman died. He had to stop to work for a famous singer. The singer found he had a wonderful voice and began to teach him to sing. He sang better and better and became a singer, too. Now he has a lot of money and lives a happy life. He is satisfied with everything but his terrible past. It was a hard time for a poor little boy. OK. Let’s stop here. Please come back in a few minutes. Thank you.
