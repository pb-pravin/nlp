Hi, I'm Dale. There are always rules in our life. Are rules all terrible? No. I get up at six thirty every morning, so I have a lot of time to eat breakfast. I wear a uniform at school, so I don't need time to choose the clothes to wear. I don't take my mobile phone to school. So I can't play games on it, and I study hard. I keep quiet in the library. So everyone can read books well. I play sports one hour a day, so I can keep strong and healthy. I help my mother do housework. She says I'm a good boy. I can only play computer games on the weekend. It's good for my eyes. And I can do a lot of other things. I go to bed early in the evening, so I'm always active in class. Rules are really helpful.
