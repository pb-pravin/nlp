Almost every child in cities has the chance to go to school, but not all children in the countries are so lucky. There is a girl called Xiaofang. She is eight years old and lives in a small village in Guangxi. When she was young, she wanted to go to school. But she could not, because her family was too poor to afford the school fees for her, so her parents had to keep her at home. Instead of studying, Xiaofang worked in the fields with her parents every day. Then Project Hope heard about Xiaof ang. It agreed to help Xiaofang to go to school. Her wish of study came true, and now she is studying in a school. Unluckily, there are thousands of children who cannot go to school. You can join in Project Hope and help these children. You know all the good work needs money. Project Hope needs your help. If you give Project Hope ï¿¥300 each year, it can pay for one child to go to school for a whole year. With more money, Project Hope can build new schools, buy good desks, chairs, blackboards and books. Let's help the children together and give them a chance to have a good start in life.
