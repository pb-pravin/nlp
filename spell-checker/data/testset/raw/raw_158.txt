Youth volunteers from Peking University visited Songtang Hospital, a care clinic for the aged and dying patients, during the second Global Youth Service Day on April 21. Thirty student volunteers from the university's School of International Studies sat at the beds of the patients in their specially-decorated "careful huts". They talked with them and gave massages to patients kept in their beds. "I felt sorry that I could not offer more to these people than talking with them and trying to cheer them up, " said Deng Yetao, 20, a third-year student. "But it occurred to me that they needed more care and love than babies. They are afraid of the coming death. Their loneliness is worse than physical pains." "Even though they are suffering a lot, the majority of the elderly people want to talk to us. Each of them has a lot of life experiences and philosophies to share. Instead of doing them a favor, I felt I was benefited a lot," said Mao Xiaohua, another third-year student. Mao talked with two elderly patients for a whole afternoon. The fact that most of patients in the 80-room clinic are aged people with diseases that will lead to death soon made the volunteers' hearts heavy. Ninety-one percent of the patients will spend the last days of their lives in the clinic, according to a survey by the hospital. "For people at this stage of their lives, loneliness is even more dreadful than death itself," said Li Wei, president of the hospital. Daily visits and services by social workers and youth volunteers are a very important part of their programme. A total of 330,000 Beijing students from 119 universities and colleges have visited the hospital. Many continue to offer services in their spare time. Some of them volunteer to hold the hands of the dying patients during the last minutes of their lives. Yin Hang, a student from Beijing Medical College, said he felt "the glory of life" as he saw the fading smile on the face of the old man who passed into a deep unconsciousness while he was holding his hands.
