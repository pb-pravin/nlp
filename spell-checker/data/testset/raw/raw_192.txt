Here comes the last term of Junior 3. Terrible! The big exam is coming in less than two months. You still have a lot to do. How will you spend it? We invited three students to share their stories. Dou Yi, 15, Beijing My Chemistry used to be poor in the past. I got scores of around 40 on every test During the last term, I decide to beat Chemistry. I will start to work hard In class. I take every possible note. After school, I spend most of my time studying Chemistry. My parents also ask their friend, a Chemistry teacher, to help me. Finally in the latest exam, I got 65! How happy I am! Wang Zhaolin, 16, Chongqing My foot got hurt a week before the big P.E. exam. Luckily, I recovered in time. For P.E. , all you need is to practise. Sports can also help you relax. Be careful not to get hurt as I did. Wang Feixuan, 15, Xi' an My experience is that for Junior 3, every minute of the last term is important. Don't waste any of them. I try to remember English words while waiting in line to get my lunch. I read textbooks on the bus to and from school. I work hard at home and sometimes stay up late studying. Want to have fun? Leave it for the summer holidays after the big exam!
