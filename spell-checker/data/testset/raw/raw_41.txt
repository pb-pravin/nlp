Is your schoolbag too heavy to carry? Heavy schoolbags have been a serious problem for students. But the e-schoolbag will change this situation. The e-schoolbag will help you. It is said that e-schoolbags will be used in Chinese middle schools soon. In fact, the e-schoolbag should be called an e-textbook. It is a small computer for students. It is much lighter than a usual schoolbag. Also it is as small as a usual book, but it can hold all the things for study, such as a textbook, an exercise book and so on. They can be made into chips that are as small as a stamp. The students can read the text page by page on the screen, take notes, or even send e-mails to their teachers. All they have to do is to put the right chip into the e-schoolbag and press a button. Some people say that e-schoolbags can be easily broken; some say e-schoolbags are bad for studentsâ€™eyes. Only time can tell us the truth.
