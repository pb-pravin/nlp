One of the most popular items in the school newspaper is the advice column . Here are some of the questions asked and their answers: Question 1: I’m always late for school. I try not to be late, but I can’t help it. Please advise me what to do. —Tommy Answer: You are probably late for school because you don’t really like school. My advice for you is to enjoy school more, and then you won’t be late so often. Question 2: I find it difficult to make friends. What do you think I should do? —Sara Answer: I can’t advise you until I know more about you. Your problem may be that you are shy. On the other hand, it may be the opposite. You can try to be brave. Write and tell me more about yourself. Question 3: I’m always at the bottom of the class. What do you advise me to do? —Molly Answer: I advise you to concentrate on improving your grades in one subject first. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject. If you do this, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes.
