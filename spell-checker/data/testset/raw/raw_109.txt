People sure change! My classmate David has changed a lot in the last few months. He used to be late every day and didn't listen to the teacher carefully in class. After school, he liked playing computer games and watching TV. He didn't do his homework and he failed in many tests. Jim, a friendly and warm-hearted student, makes friends with David and helps David with his lessons. Now, with Jim's help, David has become interested in his lessons. He studies hard and finishes his homework on time. Besides, he gets good grades and the teacher is very happy. From this, we know that itâ€™s important for us to help and learn from each other.
