How to Stay Healthy Roy was often ill. He wanted to be healthy very much. But he didn't know what to do. Mr.White told him how to keep healthy. "First, you must look after yourself. Then do something good. For example, taking a walk after supper, doing eye exercises, eating a lot of fruit and vegetables and so on. All of them are good for your health. Remember! Don't do anything bad for your health. For example, watching TV too much, reading in bed, eating too much, going to bed late and so on. All of them are bad for your health." After that he always did as Mr.White told him. He is very healthy now.
