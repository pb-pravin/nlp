Accidents happen almost every day. Some accidents are not serious but some are. It is wrong for people to think that accidents happen only on the roads or highways, or even at workplaces. Home accidents are just as common. Because very few home accidents are reported, people come to think that there are few accidents which happen in homes. There have been many cases where people fall to their deaths from high rise flats. Children often fall over while coming down the stairs. Old people may slip on wet floors if they are not careful. Nowadays, there are a lot of modern electrical appliances such as rice cookers and so on. These appliances can kill people if they are not used in the proper way. Gas stoves are also dangerous if they are not properly used. They may cause burns or, in more serious cases, even fires. But all such accidents can be stopped if we are careful and follow simple rules of safety. For example, it is unwise for people to try repairing their own electrical appliances if they do not know how to. It is safer to get them repaired by an electrician .
