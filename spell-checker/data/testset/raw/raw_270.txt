Jack is ten years old this year. He is in Grade Three. He doesn't work hard at school. His teacher doesn't like him. But he thinks he is the smartest student in his class. And he thinks his math is good. On a Sunday afternoon, Jack goes home. He is very hungry. So he says to his mother,“Mum，I'm very hungry. Can I have something to eat?” “Supper is not ready now, but there are two apples on the plate. You can eat them.” When he sees the two apples, Jack says,“Mum, I have three apples now. Look, this is the first one. This is the second one. One and two is three. I am very smart.”“Yes,you're very smart,” says his mother. “Now give me the first apple, your father will eat the second one. And you eat the third one.”
