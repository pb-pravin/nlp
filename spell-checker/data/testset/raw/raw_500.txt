Monday 12th Wind from southwest. We sailed 300 km. We took the nets in early this morning and they were almost full. All of us were very happy. Ron sent a message to his mother. She has been ill recently. Unluckily, some of our food fell off the boat and it was impossible to get it back. Tuesday 13th Wind changed â€” now from northeast. The rain started at about 7:00 a.m. The wind became stronger soon, and then the storm came. It became difficult to control the boat. The crew were inside the boat. The storm got really strong in the afternoon. The crew had to cut the nets because there was a serious risk of the boat sinking Wednesday 14th Wind from south. During the night, the boat moved 190 km northwest in the storm. The wind became weak in the afternoon. At 5:00 p m., we began to sail back. Then we saw a small boat not far away. There were two people in it, a father and his son. Their boat was broken because of the storm, and they didn't know where they were. We took them with us and sailed back. We bought new nets and more food. Tomorrow we will go west to look for more fish.
