China is a big country. The weather in the south is quite different from in the north. Shanghai is a beautiful city of China. In Shanghai, we have warm and wet spring, hot summer, cool autumn and cold winter. But in the south of China, such as Hainan, Guangdong and Yunnan, it is always warm and hot there. People like to swim at the beach. They never see snow in winter. In winter, a lot of tourists come to Hainan and enjoy the sunshine at the beach. But some people like cold weather. In the north of China, children can make snowman and play with snowballs. It is fun to play outside while it is snowing. That's why more and more people come to Harbin in winter to spend their holidays there.
