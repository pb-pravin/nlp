When you are next in Hawaii, be sure to stay at the Garden Hotel. Whether you come on business or on holiday, you will find everything as comfortable and as convenient as you would expect in a first-class international hotel. Every bedroom has its own private bathroom, telephone, wall-to-wall carpeting and colourful, modern materials and furniture in the local style. In the Mitsui Restaurant, you can choose your meals from as wide a variety of dishes, both Eastern and European, as you will find anywhere in the country. In the Beach Bar, you can drink with you family and friends in air-conditioned comfort, to the music of internationally known musicians. Or you can take your drink outside into the beautiful garden that gives the hotel its name, or to the tables that surround the swimming pool. Throughout the hotel, you will find the service is both friendly and efficient. The Garden Hotel is right on the beach, only five minutes' walk from Hawaii's modern shopping centre. Here you will find all that money can buy, at prices you can afford.
