Different people have different ideas about music. I like rock music because it's so exciting. And my favorite rock band, the "Foxy Ladies", is one of the most famous rock bands in the world. I also like pop music. My classmate Li Lan loves dance music, because she likes dancing. My best friend Jane likes jazz music. She thinks jazz is really cool. "I like dance and rock very much," says my brother, "because they are amazing." But my mother thinks rock is boring. "I like some relaxing music," she says. That's why she likes country music, I think.
