In 1917, a young Canadian woman got a driver's license and became the first female bus driver in North America. Mrs. Richmond Davis became interested in buses when she was very young. At that time, her father was a bus driver and drove a Model T Ford bus. So in 1917 when she started work, she bought the bus from her father and became the first woman to have a bus! Mrs. Davis designed a nice uniform for herself: tight knee-length knickers, silk stockings, a long tunic jacket and a cloche hat. Soon she became famous as the only female bus driver. A woman tourist from the US even went a long way to have a look at her! Mrs. Davis drove her bus from 1917 to 1931. During that time, she would often have to stop and change her own tires, because there were not many other drivers on the road.
