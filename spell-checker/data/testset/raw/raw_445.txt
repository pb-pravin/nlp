There is a famous zoo in Anqing City. There are a lot of animals in it. The lion is from South Africa. It is strong and scary. It often walks in the room. The elephant's room is next to the lion's. It is the biggest animal in the zoo. The panda is also in the zoo. It is kind of shy, it likes eating bamboo. Students like watching the dolphins best because they think dolphins are very smart and they can help people. Our students all love animals, they think they are our friends. We should protect them.
