In China, very few children make pocket money . But in western countries, most kids make pocket money by themselves. They make money in many different ways. When kids are young, their parents help them sell the fruits of their own trees to neighbors. Kids may also help their parents do housework to make money at home. When they are sixteen, they can make money by sending newspapers or by working in fast restaurants, especially during the summer holidays. There are many advantages of making pocket money by kids themselves. First of all, they learn about the value of money by working hard so that they will not waste any. Secondly, they learn to manage money to buy things they need or want, such as books, pencils, movies and even clothes they like. Thirdly, they learn to deal with their daily life problems by helping their parents or others. Making pocket money is helpful for children when they grow up. That is why parents encourage their kids to make pocket money.
