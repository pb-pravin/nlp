I'm Tom and I'm a student of No. 2 Middle School. In our school we have many rules. I think some of the rules are good for us, but the others are not so good. We have to wear our school uniforms at school. I think it is good. If we don't have this rule, some students will wear expensive clothes. They will think more about their clothes, but not their studies. We can't arrive late for school and we must listen to the teachers carefully in class. We can't listen to music in the classroom. All of these rules are good for our studies and I like them and follow them. We can't take mobile phones to school. I don't think it's a good idea. Sometimes our parents are busy and can't get home early. They need to tell us about that. If we can't take our mobile phones, how can they tell us? Also, we can't go to the movies on weekends. I know we should study hard, but we need to relax, too.
