Almost everybody likes to play. All over the world men and women, boys and girls enjoy sports. Sports help to keep people healthy and live happily. Sports change with the season. People play different games in winter and summer. Sailing is fun in warm weather, while skating is good in winter. Games and sports often grow out of the work people do. The Arabs are famous for their camels and horses. They use them in their work, and they use them in their sports, too. Hunting and fishing are good sports. But millions of people hunt and fish for a living. People from different countries may not be able to understand each other, but after a game on the sports field, they often become good friends.
