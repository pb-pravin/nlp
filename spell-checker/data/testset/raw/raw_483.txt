Last year, Bob visited Vancouver, Canada alone. He went there to give a talk on the environment. When it was over, he traveled to the Rocky Mountains and stayed in the Maple Leaf Hotel. He then took a short walk to look at the local plants in the forest. After a few hours, he knew he took the wrong way, but was sure he could get back to the hotel. However, after walking for several hours the next day, Bob knew he was in trouble. "I had my mobile phone, but the battery was almost dead. I could probably make just one call. But I didn't know the number of my hotel and I didn't want to worry my family unless I really had to, " said Bob. He went on walking for three more days. He knew which plants he could eat and he had little trouble finding them. On the fourth day, he knew it was hopeless and decided to call his family. "He was quite calm when he spoke to me on the phone," said Shirley, Bob's wife . "He seemed to be in control of the situation." Shirley called the Maple Leaf Hotel at once. "That week lots of visitors went to the city to watch basketball games, and we thought Mr. Rigsby went there too," said the hotel owner. As soon as Shirley phoned, the hotel sent out some people to look for Bob. They found him about one hour later, and luckily he was quite unhurt. "I will never go to the forest without a guide. I never want an experience like that again," said Bob.
