Does it seem like everyone you know is too busy or tired? Do you feel like you never have time to just relax? Do you daydream about being on vacation? Well, you are not alone. Most people have too much to do, and too little time. It is not surprising that stress is a common part of everyone’s life. We often think that a vacation will help us relax. But most of us find that after a few days back at work or school, we feel the usual stress. The question is: how can we make relaxation and leisure time part of our daily lives? Here are some ways to reduce stress in your everyday life. Exercise! Exercise is one of the simplest and best ways to reduce stress. When we exercise, our body produces natural relaxants into our bloodstreams. Our stress level is then reduced. If your day is stressful, take 20 minutes or more for a walk, or a bike ride. Get enough sleep. If you don’t get enough sleep, you may feel more nervous or get angry more easily. In addition, you will have a harder time concentrating and doing your work. When you can’t work well, you create stress for yourself. Enjoy a sense of humor. It is good to have a good laugh about something that relaxes us. Laughter breaks worry and helps us take a break. Take time to read the cartoon stories in the newspaper, watch a funny TV play or movie, or trade jokes with a friend. Eat properly. If you don’t eat healthy food, your body will feel tired and run down. Eat normal meals, and don’t eat too much sugary food. Sugar gives quick energy, but soon you will feel tired again. Practice relaxation methods. There are many different relaxation methods that can help you reduce stress. Some methods just take a few minutes, and can be done at any time during the day. Other methods require more time and space. Some common relaxation methods are: deep breathing and thinking, imagining peaceful scenes, massage , or yoga . Make time for some free time activity every day. What do you like to do to relax yourself? Is there something you enjoy doing that always makes you feel less stressful? Think about hobbies or activities that give you pleasure.
