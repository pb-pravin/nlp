A One winter,three rich men were travelling around the world in the same helicopter . They were a German, an Australian and a Mexican. Soon they started their talk with each other. "Why not play a game to spend the boring time?" one man suggested. "Let's distinguish where we are flying by putting our own hands out of the helicopter. " The other two were interested in it and agreed. After some time, the first man put his hands out and said,"We are high over Germany now.""How do you know?"the other two asked. He said,"Because it's so cold." Another a few hours later, the Australian put his hands out and shouted,"We are high over Australia now." The others asked,"Why did you say so?" He replied,"Because it's so warm." Finally, the Mexican put his hands out but got them back immediately. He said, "We are high over Mexico." "What's the reason?" The other two asked. "Because my golden watch has gone." he cried.
