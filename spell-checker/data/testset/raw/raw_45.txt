I will never forget the first English lesson given by Miss Liu. On that day, when she entered the classroom. we found that she was a beautiful young lady with a big smile on her face. She introduced herself to the class. Then she let all of us introduce ourselves in English in turn. When it was my turn, I was too shy to say a word. She came up to me and said kindly, "Don't be afraid. I believe you can do it. Come and have a try." In the end, I was able to do it quite well. She praised me. Up to now, I can still remember her words in that first English lesson, "Practice makes perfect. Don't lose your courage when you meet with difficulties. Keep trying and you will succeed."
