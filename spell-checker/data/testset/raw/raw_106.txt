My name is Jim White. I was born in New York on September 28th, 1991. My father found a good job in Watson Bay, a small town 45 miles from New York. So we moved here three years ago. Now we live at 29 Lincoln Road, next to the library. I have two sisters. I'm the strongest in my family. I like sports very much, especially football, swimming, skating and tennis. My parents are very proud of me and they always encourage me to be confident. I was Watson Bay's best player of tennis in 2010. It made me feel more confident. My last medical examination was on July 19th, 2010. The doctor said I am as strong as an elephant. If you want to get in touch with me, call me at 3258-3826.
