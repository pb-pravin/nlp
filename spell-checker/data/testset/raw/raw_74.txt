How to help protect the environment? In some parts of the world, many students help their schools make less pollution. They join "environment clubs". In an environment club, people work together to make our environment clean. Here are some things students often do. No-garbage lunches: How much do you throw away after lunches? Environment clubs ask students to bring their lunch in bags that can be used again. Every week they will choose the classes that make the least garbage and report them to the whole school! No-car day: On a no-car day, nobody come to school in a car-not the students and not the teachers! Cars give pollution to our air, so remember: Walk, jump, run or go by bike. Use your legs! It's lots of fun! Turn off the water! Did you know that some toilets can waste twenty to forty cubic meter of water an hour? In a year, that would fill a small river! In environment clubs, students mend those broken toilets. We love our environment. Let's work together to make it clean.
