What's going to happen in the future? Will robots control our planet? Will computers become smarter than us? Not likely. But here are some things that scientists say are most likely to happen in 10 to 30 years from now, according to the BBC. Digital money We used to pay with cash for everything we bought. Now when we use a credit card to shop online, money is spent without us seeing it.That means we are already using digital money. Using a card is much easier than searching our pockets for changes. It is also safer than carrrying a lot of cash. When ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it's hard to live without them. It's reported that people in Sweden completely stopped using cash last year, and the US might be next. Bionic eyes It's no longer something only in a science fiction movie. People who are blind may have a chance to get their sight back-by wearing bionic eyes. A blind eye can no longer sense light, but a bionic eye can use a camera to “seee” the environment and send data to the mind. Now the bionic eye only allows patients to see lights and unclear shapes. A high resolution image could be just a few years away. Self-driving cars Unlike a human driver, a self-driving car won't get distractcd by a phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors and cameras on the car would allow it to stick strictly to the rules of the road and keep a safe distance from other cars. This would greatly reduce the number of road accidents. You could even take a nap while the car drives it self. In the future, driverless cars would be widely accepted.
