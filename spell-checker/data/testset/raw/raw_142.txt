Hi, I'm Mo Hongwei from Gaomi, Shandong. I'm going to enjoy myself during the New Year holiday. On 1st January, I'm going to stay at home and do my homework. On the morning of 2nd January, I'm going to meet my grandfather's friend Mo Yan at the train station. In the afternoon I'm going to take Grandpa Mo around my school. In the evening we're going to have a welcome party for Grandpa Mo. On the morning of 3rd January, I'm going to ask Grandpa Mo to teach me to write with a left hand. And I'm going to ask Grandpa Mo to give me some advice about reading too. I think my New Year holiday is going to be fun.
