B James lives in the mountain with his parents. There are not any schools near the farm. He has to study in the town from Monday to Friday. His father often takes him there in his jeep on Sunday afternoon. And he meets him on Friday afternoon. The boy likes animals. He can see some near his house and school. But he never visits a zoo. Some of his classmates do and they often talk about the elephants, dolphins, lions, tigers and pandas. He sees them on TV. So he can only listen to them. It's Friday today. James' father will go to the city tomorrow. There's a big zoo there. The boy asks his father to take him there. His father agrees. James is so happy that he can't sleep at night. He gets up early this morning and puts some food in his bag. Can you guess what he does that for?
