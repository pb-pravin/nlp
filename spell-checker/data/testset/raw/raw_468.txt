Mr. Green has a small garden in front of his house. There are lots of flowers in it. But he has only a few trees. His neighbour Mr. Black has a garden, too. Mr. Black's garden is smaller than Mr. Green's garden. He has fewer flowers than Mr. Green but more trees. Mr. Brown is Mr. Green's another neighbour. Mr. Brown's garden is the smallest garden of the three. He has the fewest flowers, but the weeds in his garden are the tallest. There is always a lot in his garden, but Mr. Brown doesn't have enough time to work in his garden, so his garden is the worst.
