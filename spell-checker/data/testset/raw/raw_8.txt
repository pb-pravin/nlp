Woman: Life in 0 years will be very different from life in the st century. During the 0 years, great changes will take place in the world. First, a growing number of people will appear in the world and they will share the limited resources with others. Second, people will spend little time on their work, because all kinds of robots will help them do lots of hard and dangerous work. People will have less work to do and they will have more free time for sports and entertainment. Third, people may live to be more than 0 years old. In a word, you can never imagine what life will be like in the next century.
