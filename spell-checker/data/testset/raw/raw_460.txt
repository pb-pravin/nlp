Many years ago, I was a shy boy and lived a very peaceful life. I like school but I felt bored. And then I started the fourth grade. My teacher, Mrs. Gerlip, was a young woman who was good at writing, art and music. Her class was very interesting. With her help, I started Fun Club with some boys in my class. I also wrote a book called Through the Forest . And lots of my classmates liked it. However, I was surprised when fifty years later I got a letter about a reunion . A few days later, we had a reunion at Mrs. Gerlip's home. Reconnecting with Mrs. Gerlip was a journey back in time. Fifty years have passed, but my teacher still remembers every student. She even doesn't forget the class bully â€” a boy used to hit me with snowballs on my way to school. Lots of teachers thought bullying was nothing serious at that time, but Mrs. Gerlip didn't agree. She put a stop to it at once when she found out about it. Now, in my mid-fifties, I appreciate the gifts Mrs. Gerlip has given me even more. It's never too late to say thanks to this fantastic teacher. I hope you are lucky enough to have one teacher like Mrs. Gerlip.
