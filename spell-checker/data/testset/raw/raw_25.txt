W: These days many parents often talk with me about chores. They say their children hate doing chores. They ask me, "Could you help us out, Ms. Miller?" I think children should do chores. Doing chores can help them to understand the idea of fairness. It's not enough for a student to just get good grades. Since they live in one house with their parents, they should know that everyone should do their part in keeping the house clean and tidy. My son Peter got into a good college two years ago, but during his first year, he had no idea about how to take care of himself. The mess often made him ill. Now things are better, and he knows doing chores is good for his health.
