Hello, I'm David. Let me tell you something about my school. There is a new library in our school. It is a white building. Its big windows are shining in the sun. There are a lot of green trees around. It looks very beautiful. There are about twenty thousand books in the library. And there are four reading rooms in it. One is for the teachers, the others are for the students. After class, we can read newspapers, magazines and books there. Every Friday afternoon, we borrow books from the library and we can keep them for two weeks. Books are our good friends. There are lots of exciting things and new ideas in them. We love books very much. We love our school library, too.&nbsp;
