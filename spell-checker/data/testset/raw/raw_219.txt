Dear Marnie, We have to do presentations for a test next week, and I'm really worried about it. The thing is, I get really nervous when I'm talking in front of people. The problem is, I'm usually a pretty good student at school, and my dad might be angry if I get bad grades. What should I do? Andy Dear Marnie, Molly and Laura are both my good friends. The problem is that Laura and I share a lot of hobbies and we always go to the clubs together. So Molly is really unhappy about it and she says she feels left out . Now Molly wants to end the friendship between us. What can I do to make her believe that she's still important to me? Jess Dear Marnie, This Tuesday I got my final exam results and I was excited to find out that I got very good grades. But when I rang my friend Rachel to plan a night out to celebrate, I found out that she got really bad grades. Now she's really awkward situation, and Iâ€™m disappointed we can't go out and enjoy the night. What should I do to make her feel better? Karen
