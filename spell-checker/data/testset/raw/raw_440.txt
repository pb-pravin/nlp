I have a little dog. Its name is Wangwang. Early every morning, Wangwang goes to the shop in the village. The girl in the shop gives him two things, a sweet and a newspaper. Wangwang eats the sweet and takes the newspaper in his mouth. Then he runs back home. I like reading my newspaper in bed before I get up. Wangwang knows that and he brings the paper to my bedroom. When I am eating my breakfast, he brings all the letters to me. After that, he goes outside to wait for the bus. When he sees the bus coming down the road, he makes a noise. I run out, and the bus stops for me. Wangwang never lets me miss the bus.
