Hello! I'm Mary. I'm going to have a busy weekend. On Saturday morning I'm going to the Beach Park with my friends. We are going to ride bikes there because we can do some sightseeing on the way. We are going to play on the beach. In the midday, we are going to have a picnic in the park. In the afternoon we are going to visit our English teacher. She wants us to go to her home and helps us with our English. In the evening I'm going to visit my aunt with my mother, because it's my cousin's birthday. There is going to be a party in her house. On Sunday morning I'm going to the bookstore with my good friends. I'm going to buy some story-books. After lunch, I'm going to do sports with my brother. In the evening I'm going to watch TV and clean my room. How busy I am!
