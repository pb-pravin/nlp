Alex is great. When he was years old, he lost his arms and legs, so life was not easy for him. At school many students played jokes on him so he refused to be their friend. He had no friends and he was always sad. However, he faced all the difficulties. He studied hard at school, and he got good grades. At college, he was one of the most excellent students in studies. Now Alex is one of the most popular speakers in the world. He travels to many countries and gives speeches about his story. "A great life is about looking at what you have, not what you don't have," he said.
