Last Sunday, Mr. Smith took his students to the Space Museum. There were many things about space. First, the children watched a movie about space travel. They saw how a spaceship took off and then landed on the earth again! It was very exciting and the students felt as if they were travelling in space themselves. After the movie, Mr. Smith took them to see some models of rockets and spaceships. The models looked very real, but they were much smaller.The students also saw some moon stones. Two Americans landed on the moon in 1969. They put an American flag there. Then they brought some stones back to the earth.Before the students left, they watched a video showing about people living and working in a space lab.The space lab was very big. There were kitchens,bathrooms, bedrooms and a big workshop for people to work in. The people could stay in the space lab for months.
