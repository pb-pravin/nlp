Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. They usually go out to hunt for food when it is dark. And they hunt alone most of time. When a tiger sees an animal, it moves quickly and then jumps on the animal to kill it. Sometimes it can take the tiger several days to finish eating its food. When the tiger is full, it will cover the dead animal with leaves. Later, when the tiger is hungry again, it comes back to eat some more. Tigers are different from others in the cat family: they like water and often jump into rivers to swim. Some tigers live in very cold places in North Korea, Russia and China. Other tigers live in warmer places â€” in India and parts of Southeast Asia. But now all tigers are in danger. Some people kill tigers to use their skins for clothes, and their bodies for medicine. There is also less and less land for tigers to live in.
