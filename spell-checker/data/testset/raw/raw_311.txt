Do you know growing pains ? Growing pains aren't a disease. Sometimes you don't have to see a doctor. Usually children can get them between the ages of 3 and 5 or 8 and 12. When children are over fifteen, most of them don't get growing pains. Children often get growing pains in their legs. They often start before bedtime and sometimes in the middle of the night. But they go away by the morning. Doctors don't know why. They think when children run, climb or jump a lot during the day, they may have pains in their legs at night. Parents can help children feel better by buying some medicine. But it is not good for children. Here are some ways that may help children feel better: ★ Put a piece of warm cloth on the place where children feel painful. ★ Ask children to stretch the legs like what they do in P.E. class. ★ Ask somebody to help massage the painful legs.
