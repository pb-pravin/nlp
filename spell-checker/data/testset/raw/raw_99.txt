People are so busy these days that many people have no time to cook. This becomes a problem, because most families love home cooking! The food tastes good and warm, and a family meal brings everyone together. In some families, meals are often the only time everyone sees one another at the same time. Another reason why people enjoy home cooking is that it is often a way of showing love. A parent who makes some cookies is not just satisfying a child's sweet tooth. She or he is sending a message. The message says, "I care about you enough to spend an hour making cookies that you will eat up in 15 minutes if I let you." There is also something about the smell of home cooking. The smell of home cooking pleases people of all ages. It makes most of us feel happyâ€”even if we are the ones doing the cooking!
