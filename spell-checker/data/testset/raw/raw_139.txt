My name is Joe. Do you want to know my hobby ? I like music very much. There are many clubs in our school and I want to join the Music Club. Lisa and Linda are my friends. Lisa is a girl and she likes playing chess very much. She wants to join the Chess Club. Do you know Linda's hobby? Well, let me tell you. Linda's favourite sport is swimming. But she doesn't want to join the Swimming Club. She wants to join the Music Club. Why? Because she wants to be in the same club as me. David is also my friend. He likes English and he wants to join the English Club.
