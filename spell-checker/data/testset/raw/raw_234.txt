The school day begins at 8:45. Class teachers meet the class and check who is present and absent at the beginning of the day. We meet as a whole school once a week on Fridays. The head teacher speaks to the whole school. Morning lessons begin at 9:05. There are three one-hour lessons with a fifteen-minute break. The lunch break is from 1:00 p m. to 1:45 p.m. Afternoon lessons begin at 1:50 p. m. and the school day finishes at 4:00 p.m. All students study and take exams in Maths, Science and English. In addition, they choose one subject from History, Geography, Art, Design and Technology, French and Spanish. All students take PHSE lessons but no exams are offered. After school sports practice and matches are arranged on Wednesday afternoon and Saturday morning. Chess, music, language and theatre clubs also arrange meetings after school. Students may join as many clubs as they like, but should join at least one. The school has a good record in sports. Last year we were champions in football and tennis, and individual students won prizes for swimming and gymnastics.
