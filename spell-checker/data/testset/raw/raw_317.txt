One day, I was cooking with my friend Sandy in the kitchen. Suddenly, Sandy cut her finger. I went to her quickly. But to my surprise, I saw computer chips in her finger. "Now you know my secret, you have to die!" Sandy said and picked up the knife. "No, please, Sandy. Aren't we good friends?" I shouted. But before Sandy could say anything, she fainted. "Oh, Sandy," I took her to hospital in a hurry. After a doctor checked her, he said, "I'm afraid we can't help her. Why don't you take her to a robot centre?" I hurried to a robot centre. A few days later, Sandy was well. She asked, "Mary, why did you save me even after I tried to kill you?" "Because I'm sure you are my friend. Can you tell me where you are from?" "I'm from another planet. It's far from here. Thank you, my friend. Now I see how friendly people are on the Earth." Two days later, a UFO came and picked her up. Since then, I've never seen her.
