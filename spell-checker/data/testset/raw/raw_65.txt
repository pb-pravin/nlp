Bill is an American worker. He lives in a big city near the Great Lakes. He works in a TV factory. His wife, Helen, doesn't work in a factory. She is a clerk. She works in an office. They have three children, a boy and two girls. The boy goes to school. The girls are too young to go to school now. They are in the kindergarten. This year, there isn't much work in the factory. Bill works only three days a week. He doesn't get enough money for his family. So he cleans out the city swimming pool in the evening. He is very busy but happy.
