Tennis Tennis came from France-it was popular there eight hundred years ago! It came to Britain about six hundred years ago and soon became very fashionable. In those days, it was called "real tennis" and it was played indoors. Baseball Baseball, the national sport of the US, comes from an old English game called "rounders". Rounders is a very simple game which children in England still play today, but the American game is more complex and takes more time to play. Billaird Over six hundred years ago, people in England often played bowls indoors when it was raining. The greens they used were smaller than the ones outside because there was less space. To make the game more difficult, holes were cut in the green and players started to use sticks to hit the balls. Finally, someone had the good idea of raising the whole green onto a table-and that's how the game of billiards started.
