Sam When my friend had a sister. I began to think about being an only child for the first time. I thought, "Would I like to have brothers or sisters?" But to be honest, my friend's sister looks quite annoying , and I think it's better to be on my own. Then I can have enough time to be with my parents. It's wonderful. Bethany If you are an only child, people always misunderstand you. They think you're spoilt â€” you see that look in their eyes. And then you have to make them believe you're not. Leah I began to go to school when I was seven. I found it difficult to make friends. Because I was an only child, I just didn't know how to do it. When you're an only child, you always grow up without any other children around you. Laura I know some only children feel uncomfortable because of their parents' demands and worries, but that wasn't my experience. I found being an only child wonderful because I get on well with my parents. I've got two children now and I do find it scary. Nothing in my past has prepared me for caring for these two little people, and I become sad when I fail to give them enough care.
