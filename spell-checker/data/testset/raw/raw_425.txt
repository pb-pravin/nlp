A man was walking through a forest. He had a few caps in his hands. In the forest there were a lot of monkeys. The day was hot, so he decided to have a rest under a tree. He put one cap on his head and lay down to sleep. When he woke up, he couldnâ€™t find his caps. "Where are my caps?" he cried and looked up. He saw some monkeys in the trees. Each had a cap on its head. "Give me back my caps!" shouted the man to the monkeys. But the monkeys didn't understand him. They only jumped, laughed and danced. "How can I get back my caps?" he thought hard. In the end he had an idea. He took off his cap and threw it on the ground. The little animals did the same thing. Happily the man picked up all the caps and went on his way.
