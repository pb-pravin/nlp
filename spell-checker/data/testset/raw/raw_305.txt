Most plants have seeds. When you put a seed in the ground and water it, a new plant will grow from it. First, a seedling comes out of the dirt. Then it grows into a plant. Seeds often travel to faraway places. If seeds don't travel, too many plants will grow in one place. It will be very crowded! Some seeds travel in the wind. Some seeds travel in the water. Many seeds travel inside fruits. The fruit can protect the seed on their trip. Fruits look beautiful and taste good, so animals and people eat them, and drop the seeds in different places. Some fruits like cherries carry one big seed inside them. Some fruits like apples have some small seeds inside them. Some fruits like kiwi fruits have many tiny seeds inside them. Many berries, such as strawberries and blackberries, carry their seeds on the outside! In fact, every time you eat a tomato, an orange or a banana, you're really eating a suitcase for seeds!
