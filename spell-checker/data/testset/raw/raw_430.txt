Dear Betty, Thank you very much for your email. I know you'd like to visit the National Museum in our city. It is a big and famous museum. Let me tell you the way to it. Take your car from your house and drive along Hongxing Street. Turn left at the third turning , not the last one. You'll see a park on your right. The museum is opposite the park. It is open from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm every day. There are lots of old things and paintings in the museum. I hope you can have a nice time there. But don't take a camera. You can't use it in the museum. There is a supermarket next to it. You can buy some souvenirs in it. Yours, Jerry
