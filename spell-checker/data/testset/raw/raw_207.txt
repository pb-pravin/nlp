Once upon a time, there were three tortoises who were friends. One of them was a large tortoise, one was a medium-sized tortoise and the third was a small tortoise. One day they went into a restaurant and ordered some cakes. "Hey, we forgot to bring money to pay for our cakes," the big tortoise said. "The little tortoise can go home and get it," the medium-sized tortoise said. "He's the youngest, so he should be the one to go." The little tortoise wasn't very pleased at this, but he knew he shouldn't argue with his elders, so he said, "All right, I'll go. But you must promise not to eat my cake while I'm away." The large tortoise and the medium-sized tortoise agreed, and the little tortoise set off for home to get some money. A few days later, the big tortoise said to the medium-sized tortoise, "Let's eat the little tortoise's cake. I'm hungry again." "So am I," the medium-sized tortoise said, and reached the cake. As he did so, the little tortoise shouted from near the door of the restaurant, "If you touch my cake, I won't go and get the money!"
