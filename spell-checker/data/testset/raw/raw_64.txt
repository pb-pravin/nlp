I've been a taxi driver for nearly ten years. It's a nice job most of the time. I always work at night because there is too much traffic during the day. Some very strange things happened late at night. One day I was taking a woman home from a party. She had her little dog with her. When we got to her house, she found that she had lost her key. So I waited in the car with the dog while she climbed into her room through the window. I waited and waited. After half an hour of ringing the bell, I decided to find out what was going on. I tied the dog to a tree and started to climb into the room through the window. The next thing I know was that the police came. They thought I was a thief! Luckily the woman came downstairs. She had gone to sleep and forgotten about me and the dog.
