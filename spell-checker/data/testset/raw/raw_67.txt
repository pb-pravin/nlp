During the holiday, Danny went to a fitness camp. He met a lot of overweight kids like him there. The camp lasted for a month. Every day the overweight kids got up early. They did a lot of exercises. They went jogging, swimming, roller-skating and skateboarding. They also played a lot of ball games. They made friends with each other at the camp. They also learned how to choose healthy food. All of them had a wonderful time there. On September 1st, Danny went back to school. He was thinner and fitter, and he looked as healthy as a sportsman. His classmates were surprised to see him much thinner than before. "Wow! What happened to you, Danny?" they asked. Danny laughed happily. "I've been to a great camp. It helped me lose a lot of weight and get fit again," he said. Soon after, Danny passed his PE exam. Now he knows the importance of sports and a healthy diet.
