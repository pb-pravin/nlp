Lots of people like diving into water, because they can explore the underwater world. But there is another kind of diving. Some people dive into the sky! This is really a very exciting sport. A skydiver goes high up in the air on a plane. Then he jumps off the plane and floats in the air with the help of a parachute. A parachute is like a huge umbrella. It is put on the back of the skydiver. When the skydiver reaches a certain height, he will pull a string and the parachute will open up in seconds and carry him gently down to the ground. Skydivers like doing a lot of action in the air. After jumping off the plane one after another, they will try to stay in the air and hold each other's hands. They can form different shapes. Is it safe to do skydiving? Yes, as long as we receive right training. But sometimes, accidents do happen. In Canada, two skydivers were killed in 1991 when they jumped off the plane. Because their parachutes got tied up with each other, the parachutes couldn't open up and both crashed down and died.
