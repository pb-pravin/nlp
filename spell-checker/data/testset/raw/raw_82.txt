Christmas is one of the most important festivals of the year for the western countries. It is celebrated on December 25 by most western Christian churches. It is as important as Chinese New Year to people with English backgrounds. December 24 is called Christmas Eve. The children usually go to bed early and are warned that "Santa Claus will only come and give you a present if you are good"ï¼ŽSome children put stockings up for the holding of the presents. The Christmas dinner is usually eaten together by relatives. Christmas pudding and turkey are usually eaten with desserts afterwards.
