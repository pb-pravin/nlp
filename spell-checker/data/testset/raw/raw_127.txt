M: Hello, I'm a reporter of a school newspaper. We have done a survey about what you have done these days. Here's the result. Alice likes music. She bought a CD last week. She says she has learned five songs already. Amy is a member of a book club. She joined the club last year. She has read twenty books, including Harry Potter, Tom Sawyer, Little Women, Treasure Island and so on. She says reading can make her happy and gives her knowledge. Tom wants to travel to France. So he started to take French classes last week. He has written a report about learning French. Mary went to concerts last summer but she didn't succeed. She is going to improve her skills soon and become a star. She has listened to most of Avril's songs. I hope she can achieve her dream.
