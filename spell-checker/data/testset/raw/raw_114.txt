Not only adults but also teenagers have problems in their life. Here is a survey showing some teenager's problem. First, they feel stressed out because they have too much homework to do both at school and at home. And parents usually send them to different classes at weekends. Second, more and more teenagers are getting short-sighted. Some of them keep reading for a long time without having a rest. Others are crazy about playing computer games. They spend all their spare time playing those games. Another serious problem among teenagers is that many of them are becoming fat. They take little exercise and prefer to stay at home. Sometimes they even don't attend the school meetings. I think teenagers should deal with the problems. They should make a plan for their study and hobbies.
