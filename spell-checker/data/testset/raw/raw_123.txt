Last Saturday night, I went to the cinema with my father. We took the bus there. The cinema was not far from our home. We got off at the fourth stop. The cinema was opposite the bus stop so we had to go across the road. It took us 15 minutes to get there. There were a lot of films on show. I wanted to watch a cartoon, so we bought tickets to Toy Story 3 . My father bought me an ice cream. We went up to the second floor and went into the cinema. It began at 8:00 p.m. and ended at 10:30 p.m. The film was really interesting. Both my father and I enjoyed it. After watching it, we went back home by taxi.
