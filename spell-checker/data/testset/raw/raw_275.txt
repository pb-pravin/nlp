Scientists are always trying to find new green energy. Now, some scientists in Sweden have found one: the heat from our own bodies. They are putting together the heat that our bodies give off naturally, and using it to heat buildings. In general, the temperature of the human body is about 36.80C and we are always giving off some heat. Our bodies are usually much warmer than the environment around us. When many people are together, a lot of heat can be produced. About 250,000 people pass through Stockholm Central Station each day. Their bodies produce a lot of warm air. Usually, ventilator fans would guide this warm air to the outside of the station and it would get lost. But Swedish scientists are using a piece of equipment to catch the warm air and guide it to heat underground water tanks . The warmed water from these tanks lets the heat enter an office building about 60 metres away. As a result, the building's energy costs are down by 20%. There are problems, of course, "It's very hard to move low-temperature heat very far," said Lester Lane from Carnegie Melon University. He said, "Don't use more energy than you save when passing the warmed water on to another place." The Swedish scientists also said that , however, it is not a big problem and, after all, they want to use body heat more to heat homes and other buildings. This would make energy cheaper and the environment better.
