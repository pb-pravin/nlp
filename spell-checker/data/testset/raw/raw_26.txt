W: Hi, I'm Rose. My daughter Lily has grown up. She has been in a university for a month. Most of her toys are not useful for her now, so we are clearing out a lot of things from our bedrooms for a yard sale. We've decided to give the money away to an old peoples' home. Lily was quite sad at first. She found her toy train and railway set but still wanted to keep it. She has played with it since she was seven years old. As for her football shirt, she was happy to give it up because she hasn't worn it for several years. She didn't like the color at all!
