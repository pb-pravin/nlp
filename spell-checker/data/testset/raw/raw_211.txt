Anna Gomez is a successful TV host , but most people still think of her as a famous skater. "As a child, my dream was to become a dancer. I didn't own any skates until I was nine, and didn't become really interested in skating until I was fourteen," said Anna. Anna went to university at the age of 18. Although she spent a long time skating every day, she did well in her lessons. "My parents supported me through university, and expected me to do well in skating," she said. In a sport where most stars become famous as teenagers, Anna was unusual. "When I was young, I sometimes got angry at competitions and shouted at judges if I disagreed with them. That made me unpopular, especially with other skaters. I played as well as them, but I didn't believe in myself. The problem was in my head — I just didn't think I could be the winner. It changed as I won more competitions, and I was at my best by the age of twenty-five," said Anna. Anna retired from skating five years later. "It was a difficult decision. People always asked me when I was going to stop. But I wasn't sure if I was ready to give up. Now, looking back, I'm glad I stopped when I did. You shouldn't think too much about the past — just move on to the next thing," said Anna.
