Mr Smith is an old man. He is very kind, so many people like him. He likes travelling. But there is something wrong with his eyes, so he can't see clearly. One day he came to New York by train. He went there to visit his best friend. After he got there in the evening, he found his friend wasn't at home. So he had to find a hotel to live in. The next day, his friend didn't come back. In the afternoon he went to buy two bottles of wine. When he came back to his room, he found a fly was on the wall. But he thought it was a nail, so he put the bottles on it. Of course, it came down to the floor and they were broken. He had to buy another two bottles. The waiter in the hotel knew this, then she put a nail into the wall. When he came back, he looked up at the wall and found the "fly" was there again. So he walked carefully and hit it hard. At once he cried loudly.
