Mary invited some of her friends to dinner because she was a good cook. She wanted to cook a lot of nice dishes for her friends. Her friends arrived at her home at five o'clock. When they got there. she was cooking the fish. As the fish was very hot, she put it near the open window to cool for a few minutes. Two minutes later. when she came back for it, she was surprised to find her neighbour's cat eating the fish. She was a little unhappy. But her friends enjoyed other dishes very much. They talked and laughed till 7 o'clock.
