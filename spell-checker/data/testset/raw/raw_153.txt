In the year 2050, there will be different kinds of materials for clothes. Special materials will keep the clothes clean for ever. They will never get dirty or wear out. We will have less work because we won't have to wash them. So we can save water and money. And children won't worry about what to wear to school every day. They won't go to school. They'll stay at home in front of their computers to study. They can wear their favourite “Saturday clothes” every day. It will be fun. Do you think so? What do you think school clothes and school life will be like in 2050?
