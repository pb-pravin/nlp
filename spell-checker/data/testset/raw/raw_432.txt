Fiona Walker is a naturalist She works in a nature program called Nature Web. We spoke with her about Nature Web and her work as a naturalist. Q: What is Nature Web? A: Nature Web is an after-school program of the McFarlane Nature Center. It is to help students learn about the plant and animal life around them. Q: How can kids join Nature Web? A: We have Nature Web groups at 12 primary schools at those schools. Any fourth or fifth grade student can join it. Q: What will the kids do after they join Nature Web? A: Each Nature Web group meets once a month with two naturalists from the center and then goes outdoors to identify animals and plants together. Q: Do you think the program is successful? A: Of course. One of my favorites is Biodiversity Day. We want our students to find out how many different kinds of living things make their home in one small area. One Saturday, we asked them each to spend two hours studying nature in their own neighborhoods. One girl found 53 species ! Q: Why did you decide to become a naturalist? A: I'm crazy about everything I see and hear in nature. Really, anyone can be a naturalist if he loves nature. I'm just lucky to have a job that lets me do what I love.
