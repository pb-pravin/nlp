This morning while I was on my way to the park, I saw an accident. An old lady was walking towards me, but she didn't notice that a blue car was running towards her from the corner of the street. Suddenly, the car knocked her down. However, without a stop, the driver rode the car directly to the east of the street. The old lady lay down on the ground and dialed 110 to call the police to come. I calmed the lady and helped her to stop a taxi. In a minute, the police arrived. I gave more details to them and with the help of the police, I sent the old lady to the nearest hospital. The taxi-driver didn't take my money and the driver said I was really a good boy. A disappointing but happy day!
