Today is Children's Day. Mr Lee and his students are watching animals in the zoo. Different students have different interests. Some of the boys are going to the monkey-house to see the monkeys. Some of the girls are going to the panda-house to see the pandas. San and Billy are going to the tiger-house to see the tigers. Ann, Lily and Sue are going to the bird-house to see the beautiful birds. Look at Jenny, she wants to give the animals some food. But Mr Lee says to her, "I am sorry that you can't do that." Jenny's face turns red when she hears these words.
