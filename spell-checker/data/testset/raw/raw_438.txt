Katie Spotz is a 22-year-old girl from America. She wants to cross the Atlantic Ocean by boat. If she succeeds, she'll be the youngest and the first American to finish the 2500-mile trip. Spotz began sailing when she was at university, but she has never tried to sail such a long way before. It will be a great challenge for her. In recent years, she has swum all the way down the 325-mile Allegheny River and traveled by bike from Seattle to Washington. Spotz knows that she may see some dangerous things during the trip. It will be very dangerous if she meets very bad weather in the middle of the sea. But she believes that she can deal with all the difficulties. "I never thought I could run 26 miles," she said. "But once I finished it, I realized that maybe I could do something even more difficult." Spotz wants to collect money by going on this trip. She wants to collect money for an organization called "Blue Planet run". The organization offers free, safe drinking water to people who need it. It takes her about three months to finish this trip. Good luck to this brave girl and best wishes to her!
