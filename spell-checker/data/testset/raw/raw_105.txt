W: Attention, please. I have something important to tell you. Please be quiet. First, about our stay. We'll stay in Newton Hotel. All of us will stay in this building and my room number is 1138, the first floor near the information desk. The second, please remember you are not allowed to smoke in your room and public areas except the smoking-room next to the lift of each floor. Next, about the meals.Every morning from 6:30 to 8:00, they offer free breakfast. Lunch is from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm and supper is served from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. But I'm sorry to tell you we must pay for lunch and supper if we need them in the hotel. Another important thing is that the hotel has a very large swimming pool. All guests are free to use it from 6:30 when it opens in the morning, until 10:00 when it closes at night. The last one, also the most important one is that we will meet here at a quarter to eight tomorrow morning. Please get here in time. By the way, we won't come back until 6 o'clock in the afternoon. The day after tomorrow, we will leave for another city. Well, that's all. I hope you will enjoy your stay in the hotel.
