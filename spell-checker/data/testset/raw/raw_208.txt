In 2005, Cliff Jones began a journey around Britain on a unicycle, a bicycle with only one wheel. Before that, he made a film about his experiences traveling around Europe in an old car. He was crazy about cars and worked in a car factory. To save money, Cliff went to work in London on an old bicycle, which he also used to go to France on holiday. "That trip opened my eyes," he says. "I decided to travel around Britain by bike." Cliff didn't want a normal bicycle. He wanted to build one himself." After visiting a unicycle factory, he made one and set out in 2005. He was away for four months, and traveled over 8,500 km. For Cliff, the best part of the trip was arriving in Wales and seeing Mount Snowdon. "I met lots of cyclists there. They could easily ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn't do. But I was never sorry about making my unicycle. Many people were interested in my unicycle." His worst moment came when he had to drink some dirty water from a river. A serious fever kept him in bed in hospital for five long days. He didn't want to give up the journey, but found it hard to carry on because he felt so weak . However, Cliff now says, "If possible, I would like to do something similar again."
