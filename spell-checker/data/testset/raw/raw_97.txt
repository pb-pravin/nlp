When I was a child, my parents would always give me pocket money for Christmas. I usually got about 10 dollars. My mother told me that my pocket money was "burning a hole in my pocket". This means that I wanted to spend it very quickly. Spending their pocket money fast is something that American children and many children from Shanghai have in common. They spend their money on many things. They buy clothes, CDs, toys, model cars and of course food. I remember once I used my pocket money to buy a watch and a radio! What should you spend your pocket money on? Some kids use the money to buy what makes them happy. The problem is: What makes you happy today often will not make you happy tomorrow. My advice is to buy something you have wanted for a long time. If you have wanted for a long time, you will he happy to have it.
