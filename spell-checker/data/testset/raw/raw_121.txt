Hi, boys and girls. I'd like to introduce the four volunteer activities in December to you all. First, we'll help to clean up the park on December 2nd. Then, on December 13th, we'll go to the hospital and sing songs for the disabled kids to make them happy. Next, we'll fix up bikes and computers for people in need on December 21st. The last, on December 30th, we'll go to a primary school nearby to help children there with their lessons and tell them some English stories. I believe the volunteer activities will be educational.
