It was Mother's Day. A man stopped his car at a flower shop to order some flowers. He wanted the shopkeeper to send the flowers to his mother, who lived two hundred miles away. As he got out of his car, he found a young girl sitting on the road crying. He asked her what was wrong and she replied, “I want to buy a red rose for my mother, but I only have seventy-five cents. A rose costs two dollars.” The man smiled an d said, “Come into the shop with me, and I'll buy you a rose.” He bought the little girl her rose and ordered his own mother's flowers. As they were leaving, he offered to drive the girl home. She said, “Yes, please! You can take me to my mother.” She brought him to a cemetery, where she placed the rose on the grave. The man was moved. He returned to the flower shop, picked up the flowers he ordered, and drove two hundred miles to his mother's house. Today is the day for your mother.
