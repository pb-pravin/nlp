It is easier to go downhill than to climb uphill, so it is easier to fall into bad habits than into good ones. Bad habits do not come suddenly. They come little by little when people do not notice their danger. School boys first pick up little bad habits in schools and on the streets. When they cannot finish their lessons, they copy from their classmates. If they see bigger boys smoking, they so want to learn to smoke. When they get bigger, the habits become very strong and they can't get rid of them. From copying, they fall behind, then they learn to steal, and smoking do harm to their bodies. At last they become worse and worse.
