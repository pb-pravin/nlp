I have a cousin named Jack. He works as a doctor in a hospital for three years. He works very hard. Every day, he leaves home at 8:30 in the morning and comes back at 5:30 in the evening. He works from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.. He is kind and many patients like him because he takes good care of them. At weekends, when he doesn't go to work, he often goes to visit some interesting places in Shanghai. He lives happily in Shanghai, but he also misses his family in America.
