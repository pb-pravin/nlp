In 1897, H·G· Wells wrote a science fiction novel about spaceships coming to Earth. Its name was The War of the Worlds. The book was still very popular in the 1930s. On 30 October, 1938, a man named Orson Wells put out a radio programme on the book. The programme was different from the book in one important way: in the programme the actors talked like reporters and it sounded like a news report to the listeners. The actors said, "Space people from the planet Mars are going to attack Earth. Huge things like snakes will come out of the spaceships and kill people and people's guns cannot hurt any of them." When people heard this, they were very afraid. Some even left their homes and tried to hide. In fact, 30 October is the day before a famous holiday in the USA and some other countries. The holiday is Halloween. On Halloween people play jokes on other people.
