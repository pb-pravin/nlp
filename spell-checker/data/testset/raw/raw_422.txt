One day, a donkey and a monkey were talking together about how unhappy they were. "My ears are so long that all animals laugh at me," said the donkey. "I wish that I had two beautiful horns on my head." "You look well enough," said the monkey. "But just look at me. Every time I turn my back, the other animals laugh at me." "Why do the other animals laugh at you?" asked the donkey. "You look all right to me." "They laugh at my funny-looking tail ," said the monkey. "In fact, if I have a great tail, I will be a beautiful animal!" A mole heard the talk between the donkey and monkey. "Hold your tongues , both of you," said the mole. "You should be thankful for what you have. How would you like to be a mole? The moles have no horns at all. The moles have no tail to speak of. The moles live in the dark most of the time. The moles are almost blind." The donkey and the monkey said no more about the things they did not have. We should be satisfied with what we have. There are always others not as well off as ourselves.
