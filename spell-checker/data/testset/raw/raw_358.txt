People communicate with words. But do you think you can communicate without words? A smile on your face shows you are happy or friendly. Tears in your eyes tell others that you are sad. You shake your head, and people know you are saying “no”. You nod and people know you are saying “yes”. Other things can also carry messages. For example, a sign at the bus stop helps you to know which bus to take. A sign on the door tells you where to go in or out. Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of signs around you and that you get messages from them all the time? People can communicate in many other ways. An artist can use his drawings to tell about beautiful mountains, about the blue sea and many other things. Books are written to tell about things in the world and also about people and their ideas. Books, TV and radio will help us communicate with others. They all help us to know what is going on in the world and what other people are thinking about.
