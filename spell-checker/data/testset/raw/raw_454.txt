The traffic in Hong Kong moves on the left. Before crossing the street, you must look to the right first and then to the left. If the traffic lights are red, the traffic must stop. If the traffic lights turn green, the traffic can go, and people must stop. In the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come back from work, the streets are very busy. The traffic is the most dangerous. In Hong Kong, there are a lot of big buses with two floors. You'd better sit on the second floor. From there you can watch the city very well. How interesting!
