Teresa, Madrid, Spain My twenty-first birthday was in April. I was really happy to go out with some friends. They pulled my ears 21 times, once for each year. It’s an old custom . Francisco，Paris, France I’m going to be 30 next Friday. In France , when you celebrate a birthday, you often invite people out. I know that in some countries it’s the opposite – people take you out. Lin Xiaohan, Taipei, China Yesterday was my 16th birthday. It was a special birthday, so we had a family dinner together. I was happy to get some money from my parents. My mother cooked noodles for me, because noodles are for a long life.
