Most American families are smaller than those in other countries. Most American families have one or two parents and one or two children. Children in the USA will leave their parents when they grow up. They want to find better jobs, so they usually live far away from their parents. They often write to or telephone their parents. And they go to visit their parents during their holidays. Parents often ask their children to do some work around their house. In many families children will get money for doing some housework so that they can learn to make money for their own use. Parents usually let their children choose their own jobs. Americans think that for young people it is important to decide on their lives by themselves.
