Life in the future will be different from life today. The population is growing fast. There will be more people in the world and most of them will live longer. People will work fewer hours than they do now and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and traveling. Traveling will be much cheaper and easier. And more people will go to other countries for holidays. There will be changes in our food, too. More land will be used for building new towns and houses for all the people. Then there will be less room for cows and sheep, so meat will be more expensive. Maybe no one will eat it every day. Instead, they will eat more fruit and vegetables. Maybe people will be healthier.
