We have now landed. The scientists with us are in a hurry to go out and explore , but we do not know what we will discover, so we will be careful. We have travelled about 2 km in every direction from the spacecraft, but we have not discovered anything interesting yet. There are some mountains about 20 km away. The scientists have reached the mountains. They have already discovered a lake. There is some water left on Mars. Maybe there is some life. I have found some special stones. The team in the mountains has not yet contacted me. Have they lost or broken their radiophone? This morning the stones were even bigger and changed a different color. Tonight the wind is blowing and the air is full of sand. The weather has been very bad. The storm has not yet finished. I cannot go outside. I received a short message from one scientist, "Go, go, go." is all he said.
