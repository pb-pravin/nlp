Once a young man went out of his village to a nearby village. He met an old man on his way, who was standing under a tree. He went to ask the old man, "Sir, how long will it take me to get to the next village?" The old man said nothing. It seemed that he didn't hear the young man's words. The young man asked again, "Sir, could you please tell me how Iong it will take me to get to the neighboring village?" Once again, the old man kept quiet. The young man asked again with frustration , " Please tell me how long it will take me to get to the next village, I am in a hurry." However, the old man didn't answer. This time, the young man got really angry and slaned to walk towards the nearby village. After five steps , suddenly, the old man said, "Young man, it will take you about five hours from here to the neighboring village." The young man was very surprised and asked the old man. "Why didn't you answer me just now?" The old man answered,"How do I know how long you will need if I do not know how fast you can walk? So how can I answer you before you start walking?"
