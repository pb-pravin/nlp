Man can think, learn and speak because he has a big brain. In the past, scientists thought that men are different from animals because they can think and learn. They now know that animals — dogs, rats, even birds, can learn, too. So they begin to see that men are different from animals because they can speak. Animals only make noises when they are frightened, or angry or unhappy. In a laboratory, after special training, apes can understand some things more quickly than humans: one or two have even learned a few words. But they are still different from us. They cannot think like us because they have no language. They can never think about the past or the future. Language is a wonderful thing. Man has been able to build a modern world because he has language. Every child can speak his own language very well when he is four or five — but no animal learns to speak. How do children learn? What happens when we speak? Scientists do not really know.
