It’s Sunday today. Mrs. Jackson was cleaning the rooms when her husband came in. “Go and cook lunch, dear,” said the man. The woman had a look at the clock on the wall and said, “It’s only a quarter to ten. We never had lunch before eleven.” Mr. Jackson said, “There’s a big football game on TV at half past eleven.” After lunch, Mr. Jackson was sitting on the sofa. The game was nice and hoped his team would get the gold medal. His five-year-old daughter Emma came in and put her hand on his face. “Oh, how cold your hands are!” the man said, watching the game. “Go and ask your mummy to warm them.” “Why is it so cold, daddy?” the girl asked. “Because it’s winter now.” he said. “Why is it cold in winter, then?” the girl asked. “I never asked so many questions when I was small!” he answered. “That’s just why you can’t answer it,” said the girl.
