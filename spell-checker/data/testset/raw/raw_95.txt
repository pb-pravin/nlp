People have sailed the world in quite small boats. It is not an easy thing to do. That can be the end of everyone in it. Sometimes the weather gets bad. Accidents can happen easily and quickly. One family once had an accident. A big fish swam under their boat and bit holes in it. Sea water came in and the boat soon went down. Luckily these people had another small boatâ€”a lifeboat, and they all got into the lifeboat. They lived and hoped for many days. They ate and slept, and always hoped... At last a ship saved them. How do people live in a very small life boat for days or weeks even for months? They must be strong in every way. They must have hope. They cannot drink sea water. Drink a lot of sea water, and you will quickly die. They must catch rain water and drink it. They must also catch fish and birds for food. Lifeboats do not often carry a cooker. So people can not cook their food in the lifeboats. Raw fish and bird meat is very nice but it is their only food. They must eat raw food, or they will die.
