Have you ever eaten hamburgers? Do you know why hamburgers are called "hamburgers" although they are not even with ham ? Here is a story about this kind of food. About a hundred years ago, some people went to America from Europe. They came from a big city in Germany called Hamburg . They couldn't speak English well, but they can cook a kind of delicious food. When some Americans saw them eating round pieces of beef, they asked the Germans what it was. The Germans did not understand the question and answered. "We come from Hamburg" One of these Americans owned a restaurant, and he had an idea. He cooked round pieces of bread with beef and started selling them. Such bread came to be called "hamburger". Today hamburgers are sold in many countries around the world. Whether this story is true or not, it is certainly interesting. Knowing why every word has a certain meaning is interesting, too. This reason, for most English words, can be found in any large English dictionary.
