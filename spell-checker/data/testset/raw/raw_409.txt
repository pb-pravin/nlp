There was a small village by the sea in America. Every summer lots of people come here to spend their holidays. But a few of them come here only to end their lives. Two months ago right here a young woman jumped into the sea in the darkness of the night. When she was taken up from the sea, nothing could make her come to life. From then on, the people in the village began to pay more attention to each of the visitors. If someone looked unhappy or worried, they would watch him all day long with care. They would never let the same thing happen again. A week later, came several visitors. Among them there was a young woman of twenty years old. One day she looked different from others. She went out alone at night. She was found just by a villager. The villager made no noise and followed her. When the young woman was walking to the beach, the villager rushed at her and tried hard to pull her back. "Let me go. Don't pull me!" cried the young woman, "I was playing on the beach this afternoon. Now I can't find the key to my suitcase. I think it must be left here." "But why don't you look for it tomorrow morning?" said the villager. "Tomorrow morning I'll leave here and catch the early bus to New York. I must leave before the day breaks." When the villager heard this, he had a good laugh and helped her look for the key in the moonlight.
