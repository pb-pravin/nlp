Hi, my name's Sandy. My brother and I have just been to my cousin's house in London. We went there by train on Friday morning and arrived at six in the afternoon. My aunt and uncle cooked a big dinner for us. And then we all went to play tennis. It was my first time, so I wasn't very good at it and I didn't win. But it was great fun. On Saturday we went shopping in Oxford Street, I bought some new summer clothes. And my brother bought a computer game. In the evening we all went to a nice restaurant. I had a pizza, and it was very delicious. We came back home on Sunday, but I wanted to stay in London. What a wonderful weekend I have had!
