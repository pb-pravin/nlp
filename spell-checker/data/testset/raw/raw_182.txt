Mrs. Smith has two children. Summy is seven years old, and his sister Annie is four. Summy goes to school, but Annie does not. When Summy is at home, he often plays with Annie when their mother is cooking or washing or cleaning, and he is usually very nice to his small sister, and Mrs. Smith is free to do her work quietly. One Saturday morning the two children are playing in the garden when their mother is cooking lunch. They are quite happy until Annie suddenly begins to cry and runs into the kitchen to her mother. Mrs. Smith stops cooking and says, "Why are you crying, Annie?" "Summy breaks my toy horse," Annie answers, crying more and more loudly. "How does he break it?" her mother asks. Annie stops crying, but does not answer for a minute. Then she says, "I hit him on the head with it."
