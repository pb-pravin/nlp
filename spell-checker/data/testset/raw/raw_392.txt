C Hello, listeners. Welcome to Henton Hospital Radio. Before our music programme at four, I'm going to repeat some of our hospital rules. The hospital can sleep 800 patients. There are 8 beds in each ward . The visiting hours are in the afternoon from 2:30 to 3:30 and in the evening from 7:00 to 8:00. But remember only two people can see you at the same time. Sorry about that, but you can see what would happen if we didn't have these rules. The other rules are about our hours. We start quite early — you might not be used to that. We wake you up at 6 o'clock, and breakfast is at 8 o'clock, lunch is at noon. There is tea at 3:30 and supper is at 6 o'clock. You can see the no smoking sign — we don't allow smoking in the wards. I'm sure you understand why. However, if you do need to smoke, there are some smoking-rooms where it is allowed. You will find the radio switch on the wall near your bed, with your own headphones, if you want to listen. It's our own hospital radio wishing you a quick Recovery .
