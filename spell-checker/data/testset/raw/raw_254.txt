What must you do when you get a present for your birthday? You have to sit down and write a thank-you note. The words "Thank you" are very important. We must learn to use them very often. We say them when someone gives us a drink, helps us pick up things, lends us a book, etc. Another important word is "Please". Many people forget to use it. It isn't polite to ask someone to do something without saying "Please". We need to use it when we ask for something, too. It may be a book or a pencil. We need to use "Please" to make request. We need to learn to say "Sorry", too. When we have hurt someone, we'll have to go up and say "Sorry". When we forgot something, we also say "Sorry". We can make people forget our wrongs by saying it. These words are simple but important. Children must learn to use them, too. They are pleasing words to use in many languages.
