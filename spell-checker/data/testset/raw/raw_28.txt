Hi. My name’s Charlie Johnson and I’m going to tell you a little about myself. I’m years old, and I’m single. That’s right, I’m not married yet. I’m six feet tall, and I weigh about 0 pounds. I guess I could lose a little weight. Some friends suggest that I should take more exercise in my free time. However, it seems a little difficult for me. You know, I don’t like any sports. The only sport I like is tennis. But I can seldom find anybody to play with me. I’m a computer programmer at a large company. I really like my job. It’s interesting, and I can be creative. My hours are long, about hours a day and sometimes I have to come in on weekends, but the best part is the salary, $,000 a year. Yeah, it’s good. I live in the city, in a one-bedroom apartment. It’s not big, but I like it because it’s in a good location. It's near public transportation, and that’s good for me. I don’t have a car, but that’s OK. I can walk to work. And, I have a roommate. He spends most of his time sleeping and lying on the sofa. He’s my cat, Floppy. On weekends, I usually take him to walk in the park near my house. That’s all. Thank you for listening.
