There was a pilot and three people in a small plane. Suddenly there was something wrong with the plane when it was flying in the air. The smoke was everywhere in the plane. The pilot told the people there were only three parachutes . They all became worried and started to make excuses. “I must go and mend the machine.” said the pilot, taking one of the parachutes. There was nothing he could do so he just jumped out. The next person said, “I must have a parachute, I am a very clever person, and I have to take part in an important sports game. I know I am going to win the game because I am going to be the cleverest person there.” He picked up a pack and jumped out. Two men were left , an old businessman and a young mountain climber. By this time the plane was going down fast. The businessman said, “Young man, I am old but you're still young. You take the last parachute.” The young mountain climber smiled, “Don't worry,” he said, “we can both jump to safety because there are still two parachutes. Just now the clever person jumped out with my backpack.”
