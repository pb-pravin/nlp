When Mr. David retired , he bought a small house in a village near the sea. He liked it and hoped to live a quiet life in it. But to his great surprise, many visitors came to see his house in summer holidays, for it was the most interesting building in the village. From morning to night there were visitors outside the house. They kept looking into the rooms through the windows and many of them even went into the house. He decided to drive the visitors away. So he put a notice on the window. The notice said: "If you want to satisfy your curiosity , came in and look round. Price: twenty dollars." Mr. David was sure that the visitors would stop coming, but he was wrong. More and more visitors came and Mr.David had to spend every day showing them around his house. "I came here to retire, not to work as a guide ." he said angrily. In the end, he sold the house and moved away.
