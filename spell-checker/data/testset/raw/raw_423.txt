Lunch is between twelve and one o'clock. It is like a light meal and working people must take lunch with them or get it near their workplace. Children in school take sandwiches, fruit, and cookies with them or eat in school. Supper, the main meal, is between six and eight in the evening. People usually cook it carefully at home. They may have meat, chicken, or duck. They may all have rice or vegetables. The drink is coffee, tea or milk. Then comes the dessert .
