Dear Mr. Zhang, My name is Tony. I want to be in your club. I'm not famous now. But maybe I can be famous some day. I can't sing, dance, or act in movies, but I can do many other things. I can play four instruments: the guitar, the violin, the drums and the piano. I think I can be a famous musician. I like to read storybooks and I can write stories. Maybe I can be a famous writer . I like sports, too. But I don't think I can be a famous and successful sportsman . Can I join you? If your answer is "Yes", I will be very happy. Yours, Tony
