A woman was at a cinema and she was enjoying the movie. But there was a man at the next seat. He was looking for something. The woman was angry and said to the man, ”What are you doing, sir? What are you looking for? Could you please keep quiet?” “A piece of chocolate,” the man said. “I dropped it on the floor.” “A piece of chocolate?” the woman said angrily. “It’s dirty now. Take this and be quiet.” She gave the man a big piece of chocolate. ”But,” the man said, “my teeth are in the piece of chocolate on the floor.”
