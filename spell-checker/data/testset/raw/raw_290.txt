It was over twenty years ago, I was holding my baby son in arms. My two other children were playing under a big tree near a food bank. I was out of work a long time ago and my family were out of food. So my wife went to ask for some in the food bank. I tried to smile while my children were playing with each other around the tree. But my heart was too heavy. Finally, my wife came back holding a large bag of food and we smiled at each other. Thanks to the kindness of others, our children didnâ€™t go hungry that night. Many years passed and it was yesterday I found myself outside the door of another food bank. I had some money left in my bag. I was glad to share it with others. I went to a store and bought what I could buy with the money. Then I took the food to make the food bank's shelves full again. The people there thanked me but I thought it was my duty to do that. I was , after all , only playing my part in the circle of kindness that began over twenty years ago. This world is full of circles of love. Everyone has his own part in these circles. A kind word , a caring smile and a helping hand may change others' life. Try to play your part in these circles.
