American vans Americans with small families own a small car or a large one. If both parents are working, they usually have two cars. When the family is large, one of the cars is sold and they will buy a van. A small car can hold four persons and a large car can hold six persons but it is very crowded . A van holds seven persons easily, so a family that has three children could ask their grandparents to go on a holiday travel. They could all travel together. Mr. Hagen and his wife had a third child last year. This made them sell their second car and buy a van. The sixth and seventh seats are used to put other things, for a family of five must carry many suitcases when they travel. When they arrive at their grandparents' home, the suitcases are brought into the car, and then the two seats can carry the grandparents. Americans call vans motor homes. A motor home is always used for holidays. When a family are traveling to the mountains or to the seaside, they can live in their motor home for a few days or weeks. All the members of a big family can enjoy a happier life when they are traveling together. That is why motor homes have become very popular. In America there are many parks for motor homes.
