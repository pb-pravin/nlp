My grandmother is a 53-year-old woman. She loves gardening and plants a lot of flowers. She likes animals because she thinks they are cute. And she really enjoys cooking but the dishes don't taste good. She doesn't like sports at all. My grandmother has two pretty big eyes and long brown hair. She really looks beautiful. She always has a bright smile on her face. She's also very generous and likes to help others. My grandmother is very popular with her friends and her grandchildren. She often tells stories to us. She gives us a lot of happy time. But sometimes she is strict with me. She said she couldn't go to school when she was young. So she hopes that I can get into a better university. I love my grandmother and I hope she will be healthy and happy forever.
