What is happiness? What makes you happy? That can mean different things to different people . You might think that happy people have lots of money, great power , great jobs, luxurious houses and cars. But as a matter of fact, when you are poor, you can also feel happy because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy because you have more chances to challenge yourself. That's to say, attitude is everything â€” you may have a different way of thinking about things and treating things. And you can go about your lives in a different way. In fact, happiness is always around you if you feel it with your heart. When you are in trouble, your parents will help you; when you succeed, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong; people around you will help you to correct it. All these are your happiness. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy person.
