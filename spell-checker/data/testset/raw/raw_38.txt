Hello, boys and girls. Here's some information about our trip to the town of Chester. We'll go there by bus. It's a long trip for over three hours. So we have to start early. The bus will wait for you at the school gate at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. We'll take sandwiches for lunch with us and we will eat together in a park. After that we will walk around the old market. You will be able to buy all your presents there. We will meet at the place where our bus stops. If you are lost, please give me a call. My mobile phone number is Any questions? OK. See you tomorrow.
