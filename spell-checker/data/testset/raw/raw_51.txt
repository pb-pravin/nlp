The Blacks live on a huge farm in Australia. Mr. and Mrs. Black have got three children. They have lived there for many years. The children have a lot of space to run around and many interesting things to play with. The air is clean and fresh. The Blacks grow their food on the farm. It's nice and healthy. Mrs. Black can cook very delicious dishes. There is always a lot of work to do, but they don't mind. Of course, the family feels lonely sometimes. Their nearest neighbours live almost 100 kilometres away. There are no schools, hospitals, supermarkets or shops. It's not convenient. If they want to buy something, they have to make a phone call or get onto the Internet. Then they wait for several days. If someone is ill, their doctor has to come by plane. The life is a bit difficult, but the Blacks enjoy it very much.
