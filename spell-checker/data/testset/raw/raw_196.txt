A Hindu saint who was visiting the River Ganges to take a bath found a group of family members on the bank , shouting in anger at each other. He turned to his disciples , smiled and asked, "Why do people in anger shout at each other? The disciples thought for a while, and one of them said, "Because we lose our calm, we shout." "But, why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can as well tell him what you have to say in soft voice," asked the saint. The disciples gave other answers but none satisfied the saint. Final the saint explained, "When two people are angry at each other, their heart distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the stronger they will have to shout to hear each other. What happens when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly because their hearts are very close." He looked at his disciples and said, "So when you argue , do not let your heart get distance. Do not say words that distance each other more. Or else there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not find a way to return."
