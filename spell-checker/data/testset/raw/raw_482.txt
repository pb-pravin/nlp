There is a big tree in the deep mountain. A mother eagle and her three babies live in the tree. One day the mother eagle said to her babies, "Come to the edge of the nest ," The three babies moved slowly and looked down, being afraid to go too far near the edge. "We are afraid," they replied, as they hid under the safety of their mother's comfortable wings. "Come here," she encouraged. "And I will help you." They came and with a loving, watchful eye, the mother eagle gently pushed the young babies out of their nest. And being brave, the babies flew up and began their colourful life. Just as an eagle flies far above the mountains and farms below, higher and higher into the blue sky, you have further to go on your journey. Then a whole, new, clear great life lies before you. In our journey through life, like the baby eagles, we were created to have new, exciting experiences and a meaningful future. So take a step out of your comfortable home to get where you want to be tomorrow.
