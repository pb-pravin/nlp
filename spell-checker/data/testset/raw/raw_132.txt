Hello, boys and girls! Here is some information about our trip to the old city tomorrow. We’ll go there by bus. It’s a long trip, over 4 hours. So we have to start early. The bus will wait for you at the school gate at 7:00 tomorrow morning. We’ll take some bread, water and apples for lunch with us and we will eat together in a park. After that we will walk around the old market. You will be able to buy all your presents there. We will meet at the place where our bus stops. If you are lost, please give me a call. My mobile phone number is 138-4609-1257, again 138-4609-1257. Any questions? OK. See you tomorrow.
