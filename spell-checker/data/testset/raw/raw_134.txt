Hello! I'm Mrs. Smith. I'm the manager of the lost and found office of our school. Here are some lost things. A blue watch with a yellow cat on it, David found it this morning. There is a black coat, Alan found it this afternoon. There are two pencils. One is red and the other is blue. Mary found them in her classroom. Also, Jack lost his bag, it's brown. Please help him find it. Lastly, Linda lost her red hat. It is a birthday present from her aunt, she likes it very much. Let's help her find it. Boys and girls, if you lose anything, you can ask me for help. My office is Room 205 in the teaching building. You can come here between 3:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. I'm glad to help you.
