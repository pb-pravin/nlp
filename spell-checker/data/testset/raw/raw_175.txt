If you have no special plans for your holidays, why not spend your time helping others? Don't listen to people who say the young people today often think only of themselves. It's not true at all. More and more young people in the USA volunteer to spend their school holidays working for others. And they don't do it for money. Here are some of their stories. Alice Hamilton, 17 I'm going to help the Forest Centre build new hiking paths in the mountains. It's going to be terrific-I'll spend the whole summer living in the tent and breathing the mountain air. Iâ€™m going to sleep under the stars. It will be a nice sport. and I'll be able to do something good at the same time. Jason Moore, 18 This summer, I'm going to volunteer with Special House Program. They build good, low-cost houses and sell them to families that are not very rich. They'll teach me what to do, so I'll help people and also have a chance to learn how to build houses. Trish Anderson, 16 I'm going to teach kids who have trouble in reading. I'll work for a program called Reading for Life. Every day, I'm going to help kids choose and read book that they like. I want to be a teacher, and I love children and reading, so this is going to be a great experience for me.
