Tuesday, 1st September I had mixed feelings today, nervous, worried, happy, excited ... My heart went down when Miss Chan, our head teacher, said that Matthew and Beth, two students from England, would spend three months with us! I was worried that I had to speak English so much! But at the end of the school day, I was happier than I thought: the morning with them today was more enjoyable than I expected. Today is the most unforgettable first day I have had! Matthew is fantastic! His English is clearer and easier to listen to than I thought. The other English student, Beth, is the most helpful girl I've ever met. There were lots of things to do on the first day. Beth offered to help Miss Chan put up all the notices. Of course, some of the credit should also go to ME because I translated some of the notices for her. Miss Chan praised us! We finished all the preparations 10 minutes earlier than expected. then Beth and I talked for a while, Matthew sang several English songs. and did some stand-up comedy at the party. We all praised him. When the bell rang to end the first school day, none of us wanted to leave. When I went back home, I had a little headache. I have probably spoken more English today than the whole of last year. It was really a happy day! I hope our friendship can continue, even after they have gone back to England!
