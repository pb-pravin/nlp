Once upon a time, there was an island. All the feelings lived there, such as Happiness, Sadness and Love. One day the feelings heard that the island would sink. They all repaired the boats and left except Love. Love wanted to stay until the last possible moment. Just as the island began to sink, Love decided to ask for help. Miserliness was passing by Love in a big boat. Love said, "Miserliness, can you take me with you?" Miserliness answered "No, I can't. There is a lot of money in my boat. There is no place for you here." Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful boat. "Vanity, please help me!" "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet. You'll, make my boat dirty." Vanity said. Sadness was close by, so Love asked for help, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh, Love, I am so sad that I need to be alone by myself!" Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she didn't even hear Love call her. Suddenly, there was a voice, "Love, I will take you." It was an old woman. Love felt so lucky that he even forgot to ask for her name. When they got to a dry land, the old woman went away. Love asked Knowledge, another old woman, "Who helped me?" "It was Time", Knowledge answered. "Time?" asked Love. "But why does Time help me?" Knowledge smiled, with deep wisdom and answered, "Because only Time can understand how great Love is."
