Americans thinks much about time. From childhood they learn to value time. As children their parents and teachers ask them to be on time to go to school, to work and to do everything. When they are having a good time, they say that time goes easily. When a person is dying , they say he is living on a borrowed time. Time is money. Time is knowledge . Time is everything in America. A working American often works hard for eight hours a day or forty hours a week. This is the working time. In his free time or on Saturday and Sunday, he also works hard for more money. In the street you seldom see a man walking slowly. They walk very fast. They love time because time can bring them money and lots of things. But sometimes they also hate time, because they feel they are the servants of the clock.
