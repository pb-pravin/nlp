We usually work from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. However, for some people, it's their bedtime. Robert Moore "I work at night because I like stars very much. I'm the happiest when I'm looking down my telescope . The stars are amazing, and it's great taking pictures of them. Of course, my social life is poor, but I know how to solve this problem now. I'm going to make friends with foreigners, so I can talk with them when I'm working!" Tony Baggio "My work is repairing the railway tracks , so I have to work at night. I can get lots of money. However, I'm going to leave this job. I have to find a normal job because I will become a father next month. I'm hoping to be a builder. It's hard work, but no more nights!" John Millar "When I came to this country, the only work I could find was a night doorman. This job is boring because it's so quiet, but I've decided to make use of it. I'm going to start a course in art, and I can read my course books during the long quiet nights! I want to be a teacher in the future." Peter Patel "I work in a call center in India, but I answer calls from people in the UK. So I have to work at night. It's not a problem for me and I like to talk with different people every day."
