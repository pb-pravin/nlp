Scientists think that many animals cannot see colors. The world is black and white to them. Scientists want to find out if dogs can see colors. When the scientists give the dogs food, they show them a certain color every time. The dogs get ready to eat when they see this color. The scientists then show the dogs another color. Again the dogs get ready to eat. The colors are all the same to them. Colors are not all the same to monkeys. For example, if we put food in a red box, and do this every day, a monkey will always go to the red box to get food. If we put food in a blue box, the monkey won't go to it.
