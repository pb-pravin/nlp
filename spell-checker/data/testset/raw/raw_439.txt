I'm Lucy Blevins. I'm very lucky because I make my living by doing what I love â€” painting pictures. I painted my first picture when I was just four. One day, when Mom wasn't looking, I used my paint and painted a summer scene on one blue wall of my bedroom. I painted myself and my dog in a meadow full of red flowers. I painted the sun above us, with a big smile on its face. I was just finishing the painting when Mom walked into my room. Her mouth was open and she stood there quietly, looking at the wall, "I'm in big trouble," I thought. So I was really surprised when Mom said, "What a beautiful picture, Lucy!" The picture stayed on my bedroom wall and is still there today, 30 years later I see it every time I go home to visit Mom. I tell this story because it shows how much Mom supported my love of painting, When I was in school, she cared as much about my art as other subjects. She kept all my paintings and hung many of them on the walls in our house. She often said, "You are so talented. Follow your dream. " Today I'm a successful painter. I'm happy that people love my paintings and hang them in their homes. However, I will never forget Mom's great support!
