Before a movie, most people turn off their mobile phones. Some people, like Jason Smith doesn't. One day, he went to see a new film. He talked during the movie. That made other people angry. During the movie, Jason got a phone call. His phone rang very loudly. People turned around and looked at him. He didn't care. "Hello?" Jason said,"Yeah, I'm seeing a movie." "You saw it yesterday?" Jason asked his friend on the phone."What happens at the end?" "Shh!" Someone in the front of him said. "The writer is the killer? Really?" Jason asked loudly. "Go away!" Three people said angrily. "OK, OK," Jason said to them. "Do you want to know the ending?" "No!" Everybody said. Jason walked out of the cinema. Everybody clapped.
