It's a good habit to say "Thank you" when others help you or say something kind to you. You should say "Thank you" when someone passes you the salt on the table, when someone says you do your work well, or you buy a nice thing, or your city is very beautiful. "Thank you" is used not only between friends, but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives. "Excuse me" is another short sentence that is often used. It's not polite to break others when they are talking. If you want to speak to one of them, say "Excuse me" first, and then begin to talk. You should also do so when you want to cough or make any other noise before others. Let's all learn to say "Thank you" and "Excuse me".
