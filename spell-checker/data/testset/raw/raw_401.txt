A storm dropped heavy rains on central and southern parts of China last week. Along the Xiangjiang River in Hunan, floods caused by terrible rains killed 25 people and 13 people were missing. The Chinese government warned Yunnan and Chongqing of possible heavy rains over the next few days. In Changsha, water levels rose to 38 metres early Monday morning, 3 metres above the danger line. In Guangdong, at least 21 people were killed, 3 were seriously hurt and 7 went missing when heavy floods hit northern parts of Guangdong. The cities of Shaoguan, Meizhou and Heyuan were heavily hit and many people became homeless. About 620 million yuan has been lost in the floods. The Guangdong government has sent something useful to Meizhou, Heyuan and Shaoguan to help the people who lost homes build their homes again.
