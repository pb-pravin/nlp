One day, the teacher said to his students, "If you are careful enough, you will find some of the people around you need help. I want you to look around and give them as much help as you can." The next morning, the teacher asked, "Tom, did you do anything to help others yesterday?" "Yes, sir. I helped a grandma to cross the road." answered Tom. "Good boy! How about you, Peter?" "I helped Tom to help the grandma to cross the road." "Oh, very good. And you, Andy?" "Sir, I helped Tom and Peter to help the grandma to cross the road." "Why! I don't believe you at all! Did you three ones help the same grandma to cross the road?" "There's nothing strange." said Peter. "The grandma didn't need to cross the road. It took us such a long time to help her cross the road."
