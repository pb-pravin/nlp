"1 had a wonderful weekend. I went to my best friend Helen's birthday party. She had a party at home. All her friends and families went, and they gave her many gifts like cards, dresses, books, CDs, and toys. I bought a book for her. She wore a white dress and looked really beautiful. Her parents served a wonderful dinner. We played some interesting games after dinner. I was really happy. And I liked her parents very much." Kelly "I had a terrible weekend. My brothers and I went to a rock concert. It took us three hours to drive there. I didn't like the music at all because it was too noisy. And after the concert, our ears broke down! I called my parents, and they came and got us. We finally got home at 10:00 this morning, I was so tired." Robert "I had an interesting weekend. I went camping for the first time, My parents took me there. We left at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday and arrived at the campsite at 9:30 a.m. First we put up the tent. Then we built a fire, cooked dinner and told stones. We got up early on Sunday and went fishing. I caught a fish! I liked camping very much, and I learned a lot from it." Erin
