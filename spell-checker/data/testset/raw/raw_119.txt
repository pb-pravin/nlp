The town is small, but it has a history of more than 600 years and it is famous for making boats. In the town, it is warm all year round. Betty's home town is in the west of&nbsp; America . It is a beautiful city with a population of about 1,130,000. The city is big, but it has a history of less than 200 years and it is famous for making computers. In the city, it is hot in summer and cold in winter.
