When my son, Justin, was 4, he found a caterpillar and put it in the jar. Each day he fed it fresh grass and leaves. In a few weeks, the caterpillar was fat and ready to sleep. One morning we discovered the caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon . Justin led me to his room. The cocoon had become clear and we could see wings inside. A few days later, a beautiful black moth broke free from its cocoon and began to lay eggs on the grass. Justin was excited. He knew a moth or butterfly was about to be born. He took it outside, opened the jar, and the little moth flew out. It circled the yard twice, came back, and landed on Justin's arm. Justin picked it up, threw it in the air, and it came back. He tried it over and over to set it free, but each time it would return to his arm. After a few return flights to his arm, the moth finally flew off into the tall grass. Next day, Justin set the moth free. I believe the moth, like a person, was afraid to leave what it was comfortable with. It wanted to stay with something familiar, and was scared to move on and experience new things. I was once that little moth. I was once scared to move. But if I hadn't moved, I wouldn't have been able to watch my wonderful son experience the circle of life.
