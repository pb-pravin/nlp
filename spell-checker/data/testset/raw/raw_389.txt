Today I'm in Qingdao. It's a beautiful, sunny and warm day! There are many old people taking a walk in the park. The children from Happy Children School are in the park, too. Mrs Yang, their English teacher, is there with them. They are having a very good time there. What are the children doing there? Let's have a look! There are some girls under the big tall tree. They are singing and dancing there. Who's near the swimming pool? They are also some girls. They're playing games there. What are the boys doing? They're playing tennis in front of the river .Where are Linda and Lily? Look! They are sitting near the river. They are reading an interesting book. What's John doing? Oh, he's lying on the grass and listening to the birds singing in the big tall tree. They are all relaxed.
