My name is Anna. I like instruments very much, and my favorite instrument is the guitar. The guitar is very difficult, and I play it every day. Now I can play it very well. But my brother Sam can't play the guitar. He thinks the guitar is too difficult to play. He can play the drums. He thinks it is interesting to play the drums. Sonia is my mother. She is a musician. She can play the piano and the guitar. And she also wants to learn to play the drums. My father Bill can't play any instruments, but he likes music very much. He thinks music is relaxing. He listens to music every day.
