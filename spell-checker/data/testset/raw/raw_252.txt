Dear Amy, Is there any way I can get mum to drive to school? She says walking is a good exercise. But I don't think so. I am very busy and have a lot of homework to do every day. If she drives me to school, I can save much time. My friend Ann lives close to the school, but her mum drives her to school. She gets there in two or three minutes. Going by car is the fastest way. She doesn't get wet if it is raining, either. It takes me about thirty minutes to walk to school. If it rains, I often get wet. It isn't fair! What shall I do? I am looking forward to your advice. Thank you! Yours, Mary
