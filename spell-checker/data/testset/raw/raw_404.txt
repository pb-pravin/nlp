Starbucks doesn't just sell coffee. It sells coffee drinking experience. Starbucks coffee shops have high quality drinks, comfortable seating areas, and famous brands. They are fun and fashionable places to have a drink. The first Starbucks opened in 1971ï¼Œin Seattle, Washington. At first, it was just a normal coffee shop. In the 1980's, it went through big changes. The owners, after traveling in Italy, decided to turn Starbucks into an Italian style coffee shop. Their idea was very successful. Soon, there were Starbucks in many American cities. In the 1990's, Starbucks went international. They opened the first store in Japan in 1995. After that, stores opened in countries all over Asia. By the year 2000, there were more than 3000 Starbucks around the world. Starbucks is much more than a coffee shop. The company is part of many community projects. For example, there is a group of managers called the "Green Team". They lead recycling projects in their local areas. They also plant trees and clean neighborhoods. Another group, the Starbucks Foundation, encourages young people to read. So, the next time you order a drink at Starbucks, feel good about yourself. It's nice to know that some companies care about you and your environment, and not just your money.
