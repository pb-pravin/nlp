I'm Tony. My friends and I went for a walk through the forest on May 1st. We looked up and saw some trees, about fifty meters tall. And there were so many animals up there. Down we saw millions of ants, all busy collecting food. I went a short distance and then met a young man. He asked me where I came from and when I told him I was from China, he was very interested. We talked for two hours. It was very interesting and he taught me a lot about the natural environment here. We had a great lunch of forest fruit. We enjoyed sitting outside. Sitting outside made us feel free and relaxed. There was a heavy rain, but we were dry with all the leaves above us. The forest was like a huge green umbrella. We really had a good time here. I had a wonderful day.
