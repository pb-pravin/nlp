Aunt Jane's birthday is coming. She will be forty years old. Dad and Mum are going to take me to her house. We are going there by train. We are leaving on Friday evening. And we are coming back on Sunday afternoon. The birthday party will be on Saturday. I am going to give my dear Aunt Jane a card as a present. I am making it now. I am using my color pencils to draw some nice flowers and white clouds. I am also going to draw lovely Snow White on it because she loves Snow White very much. I hope Aunt Jane like it.
