This is the Shaw family. The Shaws is my neighbor. They are all friendly and helpful. We get along very well. Now I want to introduce this family to you. Mike Shaw is years old. He is a high school math teacher. Like other public school teachers, he works nine months a year. His hours are from to 00. He earns $,000 a year and gets excellent benefits. His wife, Maria Shaw, is years old. She is an engineer. She works at a bank from 00 to 00. She earns $,000 a year and she has good benefits, too. The Shaws live in a house with their son，Mark. He’s eight years old. Mike’s parents also live with them. And the Shaws have two pets, a cat and a dog. Their house cost $000, and it’s old. It has three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a small yard. Like many American families，they spend most evenings at home. Maria, Grandma Shaw, and Mark usually sit in the living room and watch TV. There’s another TV upstairs, but everyone likes to sit together in the living room. Grandpa Shaw usually falls asleep in the chair. It’s a relaxing evening for everyone except Mike. Mike sits at his desk and corrects his students’ homework. OK, that's all for this family. Thank you.
