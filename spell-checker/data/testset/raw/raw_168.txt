My name is Sam. I joined a club called "passing help" last month. Now let me tell you why I joined it. One evening this May, on my way home my old car broke down . It was 25 miles from my home. I wanted to get a ride , but there was no car. It was also hard to take a taxi. I decided to take a bus home. I went to a bus stop nearby. After a while, a bus came, but it did not go to my town, the bus driver was a young woman. She was kind and she told me which bus I should take. I waited there for about thirty minutes, but no bus came. At last a car came to me and a woman came out of the car. She was the bus driver. "When I reached the bus station, I got to know that the bus to your town couldn't come, so I returned here. I couldn't leave you here,”she said. "Get in my car and I will take you back to your home.” "It is a long way,”I said. "Come on, sir," she said. "Let's go." On the way she told me a story. A few days ago, there wasn't gas in her car. An old man drove her up to a gas station and then back to her car. When we got to my home, I gave her some money to thank her, but she didn't accept it. "I only want to help others and do something nice for somebody. Pass it along," she said.
