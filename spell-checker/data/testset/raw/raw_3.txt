M: OK, Rose, thanks for your last letter. Now, let me answer your question about health. You ask me why I am so healthy. In fact, it's easy, I think. I exercise every day, usually when I come home from school. And my eating habits arc pretty good. I try to eat a lot of vegetables. I eat fruit and drink milk every day. Of course, I love junk food, too, but I try to eat it only once a week. It's delicious, but it's an unhealthy food. Oh, and I sleep nine hours every night. So you see, I look after my health. And my healthy lifestyle helps me get good grades in exams. Good food and exercise help me to study better.
