M: Hi, I'm Mike. When I was years old, I began to study computers, and I was very interested in them. Whenever my friends or relatives had problems with their computers, they came to me for help. When other people said "We can't fix this computer", I was never afraid to try to fix it. I usually found a new and very good way to do fixing. When I was , I started my own company. I'm the owner of the Fl Computer Company. From the beginning, my business was very successful. I made more than $,000 a year when I was still in high school! Sometimes people come to me with difficult computer problems, I can work them out very soon, they are so happy. And for me, that's very exciting. I feel great!
