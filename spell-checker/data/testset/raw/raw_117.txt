I'm a fourteen-year-old girl. I get good grades at school. I like making friends. At school, I'm like a happy bird, but at home I'm under much pressure. I can't get on well with my mother. She always keeps asking me what's going on at school. If I practice singing for one music show, she will ask why I don't try out for the music club. When I make a friend, she will ask about his or her family. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't trust me. I feel very upset! Could you please help me?
