Tom was eight years old. He was a good boy. But he could not get up early. He slept until nine or ten o'clock in the morning. He was often late for school. Tom's mother didn't want him to be late for school. So she bought him an alarm clock. She said to Tom, "You must get up when you hear the clock ring." "Yes, Mum," said Tom. After that Tom got up at seven thirty when he heard the clock ring. One day his mother forgot to make the clock get ready to ring. And the next morning Tom didn't get up at seven thirty. It was time for breakfast. Mother went to see him. Tom was in bed and his eyes were open. "Why didn't you get up?" Mother was angry. "You told me to get up when I heard the clock ring. So I am waiting for the bell."
