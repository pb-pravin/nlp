W: Hi, I'm Cindy, a middle school student in the United States. These days I feel under pressure because I have some problems. First, I can't get on well with some of my classmates. They invited me to John's birthday party last Sunday, but I didn't go. Then they were all angry with me. My mother told me I could invite my classmates to my home some day. Second, I got bad grades in my last test. I feel shy and don't want to talk to my classmates. My teacher said I should try to ask my classmates questions so that I could improve my study. Third, I don't have enough free time to play with my friends now because I have to take so many after-school classes. My classmates say I should talk to my parents and tell them my ideas. But I really don't know what I should do next.
