Dear Anna, Thanks for your letter. I'm glad you like your school. I go to school from Monday to Friday. We have five classes in the morning and two in the afternoon. And we have many subjects to learn: Chinese, maths, English, PE, science, biology, music, history and so on. We also have many things to do after class. On Monday and Wednesday afternoons, we play sports. On Tuesday afternoons, some of us have a drawing class, and on Thursdays some have a dancing class. I like music, history and English. But my favourite is music. On Saturdays and Sundays, I don't go to school. Usually I go to the park and have a good time with my father and my mother there. Love, Vivian
