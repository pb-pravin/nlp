M: Boys and girls, I want to tell you something about our school trip. We're going on Saturday. I hope you all can be on time. As you know, we're going to visit the Film Museum . There are lots of interesting things there about cinema and famous stars. I'm sure you will learn a lot about films. We'll have to leave at 8:30, so don't be late. We'll go there by bus. Please meet at the school gate. And we'll return at about 4 pm. What's next? Oh, yes, the cost. It'll be six dollars each. Now, I'm going to give you some work to do at the museum. You need to write things down, so take a pencil and a notebook with you. We'll have lunch in the museum cafe, so you needn't bring any food with you. Well, I think that's all. Hope you will enjoy yourselves.
