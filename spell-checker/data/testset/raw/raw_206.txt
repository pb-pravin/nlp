Mr and Mrs. Smith live in a small town near London with their child. Sometimes Mr Smith comes back from work very late, when Mrs. Smith and their child are asleep. And he usually opens the front door of his house with his key and comes into the house. But one day he forgets his key. When he comes back home, he rings the doorbell. But Mrs. Smith doesn't hear him. He rings again, and the same thing happens. Mr.Smith knocks at the window，but Mrs. Smith doesn't hear. Mr. Smith is worried. But he knows what to do. He speaks like a child, "Mother," he says，" I want to go to the toilet!" He speaks very quietly，but Mrs. Smith hears him and opens the door for him.
