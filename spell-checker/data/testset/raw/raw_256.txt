Getting to places can sometimes be difficult , especially when you are going to a place for the first time. In big cities , many people take buses , trains or subways to get from one place to another. Buses are a popular means of transportation . If you are using a bus , you need to know which bus to take and where you can get on. You also need to be able to read the timetable right , so you can take the right bus and get to your place on time. At last , you need to know where to get off and tell the driver the name of the station. In the countryside , transportation can be much simpler . In some places , people get to school or work by boat. Some children ride in long boats on the river to get to school. In other places , students walk to school.
