Running is becoming popular these days. Many of us run for our health. Doctors say many of the health problems come from these bad habits: eating too much, drinking too much, smoking too much and not having enough exercise. Doctors tell us, "Eat less, don't smoke, and exercise more." Running is good exercise because it helps build a strong heart. It also helps most people lose weight . One 68-year-old woman runs three times a week. She runs to lose weight . "I love eating." she says. Running is good for our health in other ways, too. Many runners say running makes colds and other small health problems go away. "Running is my doctor." says one man. Running can also help people relax. So today men and women of all ages enjoy running.
