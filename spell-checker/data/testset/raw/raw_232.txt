Every year, a lot of young people in Britain finish school and then take a year off before they start work or go to university. Some people go to other countries and work as volunteers. Volunteers give their time to help people —for example, they work in schools or hospitals, or they help with environmental protection . Pauline Jones, 18, lives in Cardiff, Wales. Next year she wants to go to a university to study Spanish， but now she is living in Belize, a small country in Central America. Pauline says, "I'm working with other people here to protect the coral reefs in the sea near Belize, The reefs here are beautiful, but if the sea water is polluted, the coral dies. I'm helping to study the coral and the fish that live around the reefs. All over the world, coral reefs are dying. We need to do something about the problem before it's too late. I'm staying with a family here. They are very friendly and I help with the cooking and the cleaning. I don't get any money, but that's OK. I love my work here, and I have learned a lot about the people of Belize — and myself. When I finish my work, I want to stay here for another three months. I plan to visit other countries in Central America too."
