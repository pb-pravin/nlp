As teenagers, you have many dreams. These dreams can be very big, such as winning the Nobel Prize, or they can be small. You may just want to become one of the ten best students in your class. Once you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream true? Follow Your Heart by Australian writer Andrews tells us that making our dreams true is life's biggest challenge . In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster because a big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. You must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or it is impossible for you to become a writer. These kinds of thoughts stop you from getting your dream, the book says. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will lead to better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book. As you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. This is good as you have the chance to learn more skills and find new interests.
