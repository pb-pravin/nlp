Dear Mary,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I need your help. These years I have been studying hard so that I can be admitted to an excellent senior middle school. I never pay attention to my haircut and clothes. Recently, my classmates have begun to keep their distance from me. They think that my haircut and clothes are both out of style. Making friends with me will make them lose face. I have thought about it for several days. Can you give me some advice on my haircut and clothes? I am looking forward to your reply.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yours,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John
