Bob, I'm in New York now. Please tell me how to get to Yiwu from Shanghai Pudong International Airport . By train or by bus? And how far is it from Shanghai to Yiwu? Thanks. Kevin Kevin, I think you can go to Yiwu by train. It's quick and cheap. Take the airport bus to Shanghai railway Station . The cost is 짜 20. Then you can buy a train ticket there. The soft seat is 짜 72 and the hard seat is 짜 &nbsp;47. It takes you 3 hours to get to Yiwu. As for the bus, you can find it near the airport. The cost is 짜 180 and it takes 4 hours to get to Yiwu.
