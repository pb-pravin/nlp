An old farmer lived with his little grandson. Every day the farmer got up early to read books. One day the grandson asked, "Grandpa! I want to read books just like you, but I don't understand them. What are the advantages of reading?" The grandfather said, "Take this basket to the river and bring me back a basket of water." The boy did, but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, "You'll have to walk faster next time." This time the boy ran faster, but again the basket was empty before he returned home. The boy said, "See Grandpa, it's useless!" "So you think it is useless? Look at the basket." the old man said. The boy looked at the basket and for the first time he realized that the basket was different. It was clean, inside and outside. "That's what happens when you read books. You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read them, you will be changed, inside and out."
