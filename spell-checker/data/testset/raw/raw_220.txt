Dear Donna, Help! I'm a 15-year-old middle school student in New York. In eight months, I'm going to take an entrance exam. To prepare for it, I'm studying six hours a day. I want to do well, but I'm really stressed these days. I can't sleep. What can I do? Yours, Mary Dear Mary, Many students around the world have the same problem as you. Here is some advice to help you deal with the stress. 1. Make a study plan for yourself, but don't study too much in one day. You can remember more by studying one hour each day for six days than six hours in one day. Also, don't study late at night. 2. Have a rest for 15 to 20 minutes every two hours. Go outside and walk. Doing exercise is a great way to reduce stress. 3. Don't eat a lot of sugar or drink a lot of coffee. Eat foods high in Vitamin B . These give you energy and help you think more clearly. 4. A study partner can help you prepare for the test. When you're worried about the exam, you can talk to your partner. This can reduce stress, too. Good luck! Yours, Donna
