M: Hello, I'm a teacher from the United States. Alice, Amy and Wilson are all in my class. Today is Saturday. Most of us are busy. Alice is volunteering at an animal hospital. She is learning how to care for animals. "It's hard work," she says, "An animal keeper says I should be quiet when I am feeding animals." Amy is a book lover. She is sitting at a library. She is trying out for a volunteer after-school reading program. But she needs to read more and become a good story teller. Wilson isn't volunteering or working. He is sick at hospital. He was hit by a car yesterday. He is getting an X-ray now. The doctor says he should lie down in bed and shouldn't move his neck. Some students and I are going to visit him this afternoon. We hope he can get better soon.
