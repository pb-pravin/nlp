Your wallet can run away from you! Can you imagine that? If you think it only happens in a fairy tale or in science fiction, then you are wrong! Recently, a Japanese company has found a possible way to control spending. The newly-invented "Living Wallet" looks like a regular wallet — except for the small wheels on its sides. The wallet can be set to two different modes — Save Mode or Consumption Mode . In Save Mode, the wallet tries to run away if the owner reaches for it. If the owner continues to try and spend money, the wallet will call or email the owner's mother. On the other hand, for those flush with cash, the wallet can be set to Consumption Mode. In that mode, the wallet plays classical music and shouts out popular products to encourage the owner to spend more money.
