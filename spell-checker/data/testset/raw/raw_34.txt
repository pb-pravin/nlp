What were things like when I was a child? I’m not that old, you know — it wasn’t so long ago! Yes, I suppose some things in my life have changed. I lived on a farm in the country when I was a child, and I had to get up at every morning. Now I get up when I like. There were lots of animals on the farm and sometimes I helped my father feed them before breakfast. I like animals and I enjoyed it — especially because I didn’t have to make my bed when I helped him. My home was a little far from my school. So my father bought a bike for me. Sometimes I caught a bus to school when the weather wasn’t good. I liked my school a lot. I played a lot of sports. The only thing I didn’t like was the uniform — we had to wear gray school uniforms and I hated it. I had to do my homework from 00 to every evening. What else? Well, now I worry about money all the time, but then I didn’t have to think about money. That time was interesting and exciting, but a little short. Maybe it was the happiest time in my life.
