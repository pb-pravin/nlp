My uncle Mike is a music teacher. He never gets up very late . He usually gets up at five o'clock in the morning. After he brushes his teeth, he often plays baseball with my aunt. Then he eats his breakfast. After that, he often plays the violin. At about seven fifty he takes the number 6 bus to his school. He has no classes on Thursday and Friday. He usually goes to the violin club. There he helps kids with the violin. Oh, my brother plays the violin very well. Do you love to play the violin? Do you want to join the violin club? Please call my uncle at 116-3886.
