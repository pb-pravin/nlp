Hi, everyone. I'm an English boy. I live in the countryside. Our school is near the centre of the town. It takes me about fifteen minutes to get to school by bike. There are sixty students in my class. More than half of the students take the school bus because they live far from the school. About ten students walk to school. They think walking is good for their health and they live near the school. Less than twenty students ride their bikes to school like me because they like riding bikes very much and their homes are not very far from the school. No one goes to school by car.
