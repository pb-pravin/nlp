I felt very tired when I came home from work. I fell asleep while my one-year-old son was playing his toy. After a while, a loud knock at the door woke me up. Ah, my little son tried to open the door. From the window, he saw a kite flying in the sky. Oh, it's quite a nice kite! I got up and looked out of the window. Two boys were flying the kite. I took my son out to the yard. "I'm glad to see you," I asked one boy. "Would you please tell me in which shop you bought the kite? My son likes it very much and I want to buy one for him. " "We made it ourselves. " "If he likes, he can take it," said the other boy. "Thank you just the same, little boy. I'm going to make a kite for him. Thank you!"
