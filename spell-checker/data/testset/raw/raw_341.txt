What should you take in with you when you take an exam? Pen, pencil, eraser, ruler..., and don't forget a bottle of water! According to a study at the British Psychological Society Annual Conference held in London, students who bring water into exams may improve their grades by up to 10 percent. Scientists at the University of East London and the University of Westminster, UK, did a study on 447 students. The students were studying for different degrees at the University of East London. Only 25 percent of them entered the exam hall with something to drink. Scientists then compared their exam results with their normal schoolwork grades. They found that all those who had brought drinks with them got better grades by between 2 and 10 percent. It is unclear why drinking water improves exam results. But scientists say having enough water in our bodies and not feeling thirsty could have a helpful effect on our brains. Drinking water may also cut down on anxiety , which has a bad effect on exam performances, according to Chris Pawson, PhD, of the University of East London. "Whatever the explanation, it is clear that students should try hard to stay hydrated with water during exams," he said. So next time, when you are going to have a big exam, try bringing a bottle of water with you. Who knows-it may help you pass the exam!
