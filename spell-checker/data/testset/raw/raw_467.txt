Tom was having a dinner at a restaurant when John Smith came in, John worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he works at a bank now. He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. What is more, he never lends money to others. When John saw Tom, he came up and sat at the same table. He has never borrowed money from Tom. While John was eating, Tom asked him for two dollars. To Tom's surprise, he gave Tom the money at once. "I have never borrowed any money from you, "John said, "so now you can pay my dinner."
