Hello! My name is Rick Lee. I was born in Sierra Leone, in Africa. My parents lived there for four years. We left when I was only two. Next year we’re going back there on holiday. My parents are going to visit some of their old friends and I’m going to go sailing. Now we live in China. Like most students, I go to a public school in China. Our school is very strict and it has many rules. We have to wear uniforms in the school. Girls wear a blue skirt and white T-shirt. Boys wear black pants and a white shirt. I keep my hair very short. And girls also can’t keep their hair long in the school. We study very hard. We go to school from 00 to and we have to do about three hours of homework every day. We are given exams in the middle of the year and at the end of the year. Boys and girls study in different classes. The only time we are together is for after school clubs and activities. There are a lot of clubs in our school. I’m going to join the sports club next week. My favorite sport is football, but I also like tennis, baseball and basketball. I can play them very well. Vacations in China are similar to Sierra Leone. School is closed for two months in the summer and we have a one-winter vacation in January or February.
