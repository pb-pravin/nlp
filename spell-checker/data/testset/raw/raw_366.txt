My son, Owen, was angry on holiday with my dad. On the way back to the airport, they stopped at a hotel for the night. They didn't notice that Puppy, my son's pet dog, was lost until the next night when Owen was going to bed. Owen has autism ï¼Œand he cannot sleep without Puppy. My dad called the hotel to see if Puppy was there. In fact, someone there had found puppy and the hotel mailed Puppy to my dad. They hoped that it would reach my son before the flight home. But Puppy didn't make it, and Owen had to go home with my dad alone. The flight home was filled with kind people. A lady saw Owen was upset about Puppy, so she went and bought another dog for him. I can never thank the hotel enough for sending Puppy back when they did not have to, or the lady at the airport who made Owen feel a little safer. Owen never forgot about Puppy's trip, so when he got two tickets to a basketball game, he decided to give them to two friends. They were basketball fans and they were going to watch the game outside. Owen told me that Puppy would have never come home if people had not been nice, so he wanted to be nice to others. Owen opens doors for others, and he is always giving his old toys away to kids who don't have any. Every time he does that, his face lights up with pride.
