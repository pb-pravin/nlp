It was the Greek shopkeeper in a small corner shop in London. She taught me about the great power of an act of kindness. I was a student, single and very poor. I would work early mornings and late nights to pay for my studies. On the day I went to that shop for the first time, I was sick with a very high fever. I had been off work for a few days, and I had run out of food. I had no friends nearby who could help. So I ventured out to get some food. I went into the Greek shop because it was close. I picked up a few items, and then handed them to the shopkeeper. She said, "You're unwell." I nodded. She pointed at the bread I was buying and said, I can make you a sandwich, so you don't have to do it yourself. So she made the sandwich and asked me to wait a moment. She went in the back room and reappeared with a bowl of hot soup. "It will warm you up," she said with a smile. Her smile warmed me up. It made me want to be as kind as the shopkeeper. I was a quite shy boy, but from that day on, I didn't let the shyness prevent me from helping others.
