My pen pal Peter is from French. He lives in Paris. He is of medium build and has blond hair. He is a doctor. He likes his job very much. He usually visits other countries. Last summer, Peter came to Beijing on vacation. We visited lots of places: the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, Tian an men Square and the Palace Museum. He said, "I love the places. They are great!" We had much delicious food in some restaurants. Peter said, "I like Peking Duck, but I don't like Chinese noodles or dumplings." We also saw animals in the zoo. He said, "I like the pandas. They are cute. But I can't stand the lions, because they are dirty and lazy." Now Peter is visiting Singapore.
