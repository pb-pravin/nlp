It would be lots of fun. There are lots of animals like kangaroos and koalas there. I do love animals. I don't want to lie in bed and watch TV for 10 hours every day. It's boring. Linda I'm planning to go to a real cold place like Antarctic. And I'd like to take photos with penguins. I like penguins very much. They are so lovely. I hate lying on a hot beach doing nothing. Jim I'm dreaming of a trip to the Disneyland in America in my holiday. But I know it would cost a lot of money. I'd like to go there with one of my penfriends in California. He often sends me postcards. But my mum wants me to learn swimming this summer. Actually, I don't like swimming at all. Sarah  I want to go to some very hot and sunny places in my holiday like Egypt. I'd like to travel on a camel. Me, my camel and sand, sand, sand everywhere. It would be a perfect holiday. I don't want to be on that island I went to last summer. I'm so afraid of big mice there.
