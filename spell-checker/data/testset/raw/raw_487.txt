Everyone needs friends. But how do you find real friendship and keep it? The Care and Keeping of Friends written by the American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed and take care of it to make it grow. A good friend should be kind. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should be a good listener and do his or her best to help you. But things cannot always be happy. Sometimes even the best friends have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter. Sally says there are three steps that you can take: tell him or her how you are feeling, say what your friend has done wrong, and tell why you did this or that.
