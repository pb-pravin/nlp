Name: Mark Age: 13 Grade: 8 Class: 4 Q1: Why do you eat lunch at school? My mother is a nurse. She often goes to the work very early and doesn't have time to make me a packed lunch. But she makes sure I eat a healthy dinner. Q2: What do you eat for your lunch today? The cooks make different things today. I choose noodles, an apple, a cookie and a glass of milk. Q3: Do you always drink milk? It's not my favorite. I like juice best, but they haven't got any juice today. Q4: What do you often have? I often have a cookie. It isn't healthy, but it is my favorite. Q5: Do you usually eat an apple? No, I don't like it. Sometimes I give my apple to my friend Sam. Sam gives me some chocolate for the apple. Q6: Does Sam like chocolate? Yes, but he likes apples too. His mother gives him lots of chocolate! Reported by Melissa March 25, 2014
