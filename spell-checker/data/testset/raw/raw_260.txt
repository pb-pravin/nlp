Bill was only four years old. After lunch every day, his mother took him to his bedroom and put him on his bed to rest for an hour, but Bill never slept. He usually made a lot of noises, and got out of the bed every few minutes. One afternoon, Bill's mother put him on his bed and left the room. Ten minutes later, she heard a big noise. She hurried to Bill's room. Bill wasn't there, but his trousers were on the bed. She looked for him in the other room. Bill was not there, either. She was angry. She shouted, "Are you running here and there without your trouser on?" "No, Mrs. Brown." Answered a man from the door. "Here is a letter for you and I am wearing my trousers."
