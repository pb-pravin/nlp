Australia is big, but the population there is thin. The population is the same as that of Shanghai, a city of China. Australia is a young and diverse nation and Australian people come from many different countries. Australia has many, many sheep. After a short drive from town you will see sheep around you. You can also find kangaroo has a "bag" below its chest. The mother kangaroo keeps its baby in the "bag". Australia is considered to be a relaxed, informal society . When greeting others, students and young people say "Hello" or "Hi". Sometimes they will say "How's it going?" or "G day". In more formal situations they usually shake hands the first time they meet. "Good morning", " Good afternoon" or "Pleased to meet you" are formal greetings. English is Australia's national language.
