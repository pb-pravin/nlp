Mr. Jones went into his teashop again one morning, and sat on one of his seats at the corner. Many other people also came in, but most of them did not stay long. After fifteen minutes, a young man and a young woman came in. There were only two empty seats at the corner, one on Mr. Jones's left, and the other on his right. The young man sat on one, and the young woman on the other, but Mr. Jones immediately asked to change places with him so that the man and the woman could be together. "Oh, that isn't necessary," the young woman said, but Mr. Jones insisted. When the young man and the young woman were side by side, the young man said to her, "Well, this kind old man wanted us to sit together, so may I introduce myself? My name's Jack, What's yours?"
