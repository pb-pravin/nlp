Jack was ill, so he went to see the doctor. In the doctor's waiting room there were many people. They waited in a queue. It was Jackâ€™s turn, and the doctor asked him, "What's wrong with you?" Jack said, "I'm not feeling well. I feel tired if I walk for a few minutes." The doctor looked over Jack carefully. At last he said, "I'm afraid you've caught a bad cold. If you stay in bed for two or three days and take some medicine, you'll be well very soon. Don't worry." Jack gave the doctor many thanks and went home happily.
