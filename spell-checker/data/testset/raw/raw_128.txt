They look like real black-and-white photos. But in fact, they are all drawings by Paul Cadden, a Scottish artist. He travels around the world and takes thousands of photos. When he returns home, he draws on a piece of paper using only a pencil. It sometimes takes Mr. Cadden more than three months to finish one painting or drawing.&nbsp; All of his pictures are about ordinary people doing everyday things. He wants to show a real world to people. Once, he travelled to China and stayed in Hong Kong for three weeks. In one painting, he drew a man walking in the street in Hong Kong.
