Foreign visitors are often puzzled in Japan because most streets there don't have names. In Japan, people use landmarks instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers,"Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go past a fruit market. The post is across from the bus stop." In the Midwest of America, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat. In many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas, for example, people will say, "Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile." People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map. They measure distance by telling time."How far away is the post office?‚Äùyou ask. they answer,"it's about five minutes from here." You say,"Yes, but how many miles away is it?" They don't know. People in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because few visitors understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek will often say,"Follow me." Then he'll lead you through the streets of the city to the post office. Sometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. A New Yorker might say,"Sorry, I have no idea." But in Yucatan, Mexico, no one answers "I don't know." People in Yucatan think "I don't know." is not polite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get very, very lost in Yucatan! One thing will help you everywhere. You might not understand a person's words, but maybe you can understand his body language. He or she will usually turn and then point in the correct direction. Go on in that direction and you may find the post office!
