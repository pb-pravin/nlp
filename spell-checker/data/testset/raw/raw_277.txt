Three days ago, the boss of a gold shop received a letter. As he was very busy, the letter was on his desk till dinner time. When he opened it, a $1,000 note fell out onto the desk. With the note was a short letter: Dear Sir, I got married forty years ago. Unfortunately, at that time, there was a lot of unemployment and I got no job. I was out of work for about six months before I got another one. Of course， I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring one day. The assistant brought some rings for me to have a look, later she was called away for a moment, and then I put one of the rings into my pocket. When she came back, I said I did not know the size of my girlfriend's finger. So I left the shop with the ring， but I didn't pay for it. My wife died a month ago, and the fact that I never paid for her ring has been on my conscience all these years. I always feel guilty about that. At that time， the ring cost $100, and I think that is about ten times at today's price. Now, I am sending you that amount. Yours truly, A customer After reading the letter, the boss said, "well, life is always full of surprise!"
