Dear friend, I am an American girl. My name is Sarah King, I am thirteen years old. I have two brothers. They are middle school students too. We go to school from Monday to Friday. We don't have any lessons on Saturday and Sunday. My father and my mother are teachers. They always say China is great. I like reading. I am reading a Chinese storybook. I think it's very interesting. My brothers and I like football and basketball. What sports do you like? Let's be good pen pals, OK? Please write to me soon. Yours, Sarah King
