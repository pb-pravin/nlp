Why is it that some people seem to learn several languages without any effort, while for others learning just one foreign language is neither enjoyable nor successful? What makes learning a new language so easy for some and so difficult for others? We each have our own preferred way of learning as a result of our cultural and educational backgrounds and our personalities. Experts have identified different learning styles. Visual Learners usually enjoy reading and prefer to see images of the words they are learning. They like looking at pictures and flashcards. Auditory Learners, on the other hand, prefer to learn by listening. They enjoy conversations and talking to others. They don't need to see words written down. One study revealed that Japanese students tend to be Visual Learners, while English-speaking American prefer the auditory learning style. Some people like to learn by using their hands to touch objects, while others like to move around and need frequent breaks from sitting at a desk. There are Analytical Learners, meaning they enjoy understanding how the language works. They love studying grammar rules and like to focus on details, whereas Global Learners are more interested in communicating their ideas and are not worried about whether what they say is grammatically correct. In spoken English, the Japanese tend to be Reflective Learners. They think carefully before they speak to ensure their message is accurate. They do not make so many mistakes but their communication is slower. European learners tend to be Impulsive Learners. They speak more fluently and worry about how well they are communicating rather than how many mistakes they are making. So, to do well in a language, you should identify your style and try to find a class that will teach you the way you want to learn. For example, if you are a Reflective Learner, you may not do so well in a purely conversational class and as an Auditory Learner, you probably don't want to do so much reading. In fact if you are an Auditory Learner, you are probably not enjoying yourself right now!
