When I take a walk around the park. I often see many people walk with dogs. Perhaps a dog is one of the most useful animals in the world. People keep dogs for different reasons. In the past many people kept dogs mainly for their safety. But now more and more people keep dogs as their friends. For a child, a dog is a friend when he has no other children to play with. For young people, a dog is their friend when they are alone at home. For old people, a dog is their child when their own children grow up and leave home. Now you can see the reasons why people keep dogs.
