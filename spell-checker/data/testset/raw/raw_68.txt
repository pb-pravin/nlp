There was something wrong with Mrs. Black's skin that always gave her a lot of trouble. So one day she went to see her doctor. But he could not find anything wrong with her. Then he sent her to the hospital for tests. And soon the hospital sent the results of the tests to Mrs. Black's doctor. The next morning, the doctor telephoned her to give her a list of things that he thought she should not eat, as any of them might be the cause of her skin trouble. Mrs. Black carefully wrote down all the things on a piece of paper. Then she left it beside the telephone and went out to a ladies' meeting. Two hours later she got back home. And she found her husband was waiting for her. There was a big basket full of packages beside him. When he saw her, he said, "Hi, dear. I have done all your shopping for you." "Done all my shopping?" She asked in surprise, "But how did you know what I wanted?" "Well when I got home, I found your shopping list beside the telephone," answered her husband. "So I went to the shops and bought all the things you had written down." "Oh, my dear! You have bought all the things the doctor did not let me eat," said Mrs. Black.
