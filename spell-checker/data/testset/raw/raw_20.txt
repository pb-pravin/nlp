There was once an emperor who loved clothes very much. One day, two brothers told the emperor that they could make the best clothes for him, but he must give them silk and gold. The emperor agreed. The brothers took away all the silk and gold. Then they told the emperor the clothes they made were special because only clever people could see them. When the emperor put on the clothes, all he could see was his underwear. But he didn't want people to think he was stupid, so he said the clothes were beautiful. Then he walked around the city in his new clothes until one boy shouted, "The emperor isn't wearing any clothes!" What happened next? Could you tell me?
