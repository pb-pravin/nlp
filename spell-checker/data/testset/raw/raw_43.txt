Good afternoon, boys and girls. I have something important to tell you. We're going to do some cleaning after school. The radio says it will be windy at night, so please remember to close the doors and windows when you leave. Please don't forget to put on more clothes. Mr. Wang is away today. He is ill in hospital. I hope you can go to see him. But you don't need to buy him anything. By the way, there's a lot of homework this evening. You must finish doing it and bring it to school tomorrow morning. You'd better not watch TV till too late. Now let's begin our cleaning.
