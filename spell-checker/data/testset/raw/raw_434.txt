How many friends do you have on Renren or Sina Weibo? Hundreds? But a new study has found that online friendships bear little resemblance to the ones in the real world. Being counted as a real friend means meeting up at least twice a month and calling or testing each other for eight times over the same period. What's more, friendships must last for at least three years before the two people can say they are best friends. The findings are the result of a new study which looked at the impact of social media on offline friendships. In order to become real friends, shared experiences such as holidays and schooling are necessary. Friends should also know plenty about each other, including who they like and what their favourite food is. "These days, most people spend a lot of time keeping in touch by social media."said a teacher. "But our study shows that this alone does make for meaningful friendships, and most of us still believe in the traditional values of friendship." What are good friendship? Spending time together, being there for important life experiences and doing thoughtful things such as giving presents on festivals are the things that really matter.
