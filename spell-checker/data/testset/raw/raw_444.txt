Would you think a turtle could save a person's life? No? Well. One turtle did just that. This was not a pet turtle. It was too big to swim in a dish. You wouldn't want to keep it in the house. The turtle that saved the person's life was a giant sea turtle. It was more than three feet long. One day the turtle was swimming in the Pacific Ocean. A big ship was going by. One of the sailors fell into the water. No one saw him fall, and the ship moved away. The man was alone in the water. He was sure he was going to die. Then he saw the turtle. He held on to the turtle's back. The two of them - man and the turtle - swam along. At last help came. Many hours later, a passing ship saw the man and picked him up. The great turtle then swam away.
