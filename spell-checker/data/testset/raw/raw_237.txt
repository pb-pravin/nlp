Anna in United Kingdom: I think all kids in this world should care about the environment. Kolya from Belarus: I think children should feed animals and birds and plant trees. We mustn't make the water dirty. Catherine from the United States: If there aren't enough dustbins in the world, I'd like to make some, not for the money, but for the environment! I can start a "clean up around the community" and people will realize the importance of the environment. I can go to many schools to show and teach them about the environment. Both for kids and adults. Victoria from Russia: I don't think I can do much, but I can do some simple, small things such as planting trees, feeding birds, or I can make birdhouses for them, take care of nature, clean some places of rubbish. All of these will help to keep our environment clean, beautiful and, in future, the world will be a better place.
