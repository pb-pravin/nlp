Robots have a long history. The first one was made by a Greek inventor. You may have seen robots in some films. The robots in these films are stronger, faster and cleverer than people. In real life, most robots are used in factories. They are used to do many dangerous, difficult or boring jobs. Some people can't look after themselves and robots are used to help them. For example, some people are blind and they use a dog to help themselves move around. This dog is called a guide dog. In the future, robot dogs might take the place of these guide dogs. Scientists have already made robots to help them. Robots are also used in American hospitals. At one hospital, a robot takes meals to the sick people's room. It never loses its way because it has a map of the hospital in its computer system. In the future, robots will do everything for people. But they will never take the place of human beings. They can, however, help us in a lot of different ways.
