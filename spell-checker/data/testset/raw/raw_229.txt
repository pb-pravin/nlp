Do you have healthy habits ? Mary White Yeah! I think my habits are very healthy. Every day I get up early and go to bed early. Every morning I eat breakfast and eat well. I eat fruit and vegetables every day. And every day I play soccer for two hours with my friends. Alan Green No, I don't. I get up late so I have no time to eat breakfast. For lunch, I usually eat lots of hamburgers. I know they are not good for me but I like them. I never play sports. In the evening, after I finish my homework, I usually play computer games. I go to bed late, at about eleven o'clock. Helen Hand Yes. My habits are very good. I never eat unhealthy food. Ice-cream tastes good but I never eat it. It's unhealthy. Every day I get up at six o'clock and go to bed at eight thirty. I eat well and play sports every day. I run with my father for half an hour in the morning. So I'm very healthy.
