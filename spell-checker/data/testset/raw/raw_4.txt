M:Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Lincoln School Parent-Teaching Meeting. Before we begin our meeting, I'd like to talk to you about something very important. Well, let's take our city as an example. The population of our city is about million. The number means not only children but also grown-ups. Now, how many grown-ups--I mean people over --do you think are illiterate in our city? But first, let me tell you what "illiterate" means. It means that people who can't read road signs and maps are illiterate. They can't write letters. And they can't read bedtime stories to their children. Take a minute to think about this. How many grown-ups would you guess are illiterate in our city? You'll be surprised. In our city, there are almost one million illiterate grown-ups. I think we have to know what's happening in our school. We have to make sure that every student who leaves our school isn't illiterate. It's not only our duty but also yours. I hope we can discuss the problem at this meeting.
