Madison is only 14 years old. She is a girl full of love. When she was 4, she began to study how to play the violin. And she was really good at it. She wanted to help the poor children in her town, so she did something to get some money by playing the violin in the street. At first, only a few people gave her some money. After three days, she put a sign by her, saying why she was doing so. When people saw the sign, they were all moved and began to help her with the work. Madison sold her favourite toys to get money, too. When her teacher and classmates got to know this, they all began to sell their old toys, clothes, and books to get money, too. Madison did this two years ago, and now she has got more than Â£3000. She says she will go on doing this to help more poor children.
