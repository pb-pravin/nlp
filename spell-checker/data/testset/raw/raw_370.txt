&nbsp; &nbsp; Alice often sings and she can play the guitar. She wants to be a musician. After school she goes home. She sees a poster on the wall. It says: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Musician wanted for a party &nbsp; &nbsp; We're going to have a party next Saturday. We want a musician for our party. If you sing well and can play the guitar, please call Helen at 493-7856. &nbsp; &nbsp; Alice is very happy. She calls Helen. Helen asks her to the school art club. They hope she can sing and play the guitar.
