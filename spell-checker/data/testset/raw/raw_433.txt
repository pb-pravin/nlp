R: What is the best part about your job as an animator ? S: I love to be able to bring a character to life. If I can imagine it, I can make it happen on the screen. It's a great feeling. R: What was your favorite project ? S: My favorite project was a movie called It's a Zoo Out There . Unlike commercials and TV shows, a movie is longer and usually lets you explore the characters and story. For It's a Zoo Out There , I worked with a fun team of animators to create more than thirty animal characters. It was really an interesting experience. R: How long does it take you to finish a project? S: Well, it depends. It might take me a week to finish my part of a short commercial. As for a movie, one year may be not enough. It also depends on whether I'm drawing by hand or using a computer. Computers make the work go much faster. However, I sometimes find that drawing by hand is more creative. R: Do you have any plans in the near future? S: I will take a long holiday. I plan to visit some other countries. After that, I will continue working hard. I hope to make more animated movies!
