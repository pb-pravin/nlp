We will arrive at a British city park in a few minutes. In the park, you can feel the cool air coming from the lake. This is a favorite place for visitors in late summer, especially on a sunny and hot summer afternoon like today. This area is one of the British national parks. Look at those beautiful houses around the lake over there. They were built about four hundred years ago, so in this park, you can have a special place for an outing. People like to have a good walk around it. I'm sure we'll have a comfortable and relaxing walk around the park today.
