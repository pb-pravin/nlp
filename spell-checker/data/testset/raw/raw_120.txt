Good afternoon. It's four o'clock and you are listening to the CRI online from Beijing. I'm Lin Bin. The Danish Queen with some officers visited China last week. It's her second visit to China. She visited some big cities in East China. The visit lets us know about her much more. She is very kind and active. Especially, she has been interested in Chinese culture. So during her stay, she also visited some traditional buildings. Her visit will make the two countries become much closer. She hopes to learn Chinese and make friends with more Chinese on the Internet someday.
