In 2050 we will still celebrate most of the same festivals as people celebrate now, and for us Chinese people the most important festival is still Spring Festival. People sometimes call Spring Festival "Lunar New Year." "Lunar" means "something to do with the moon," and you will never guess where I will spend the "Lunar New Year" in 2050 — I want to spend it on the moon! In autumn, 2049, Mc Donald's will hold a competition to celebrate the opening of their first branch on the moon. The first prize is a trip to the moon for the winner and his or her family. The winner will be allowed to choose when to take the trip. Luckily, I win the prize! I decide to go at Spring Festival. By 2048 or 2049, we may have learnt in our history class that the first space tourist is a rich businessman who paid millions of dollars to be allowed to take a ride on a rocket Space travel will be a lot more common than it is now. But it is still something only billionaires can afford. Common families like mine can hardly have the chance to take holidays in space. So we will be all very happy and thrilled when we really arrive at Jiuquan Space Centre in Gansu. The television cameras are there to record pictures of us getting into the space bus and then it is "…3, 2,1 -Go!" We are on our way to the moon.
