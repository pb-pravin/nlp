He saw a shop on the corner and walked to it. The shop was very small. There was a piece of paper on the window. It said,"Business for Sale. " The movie star went into the shop. There was an old man sitting in it. He looked at the movie star very carefully. Then he said,"Are you going to buy this shop?" The movie star smiled and said, "No,l' m lost. Can you tell me how to get to Third Street?" The old man stood up and told him the way. " Thank you very much," the movie star said and walked on. A few meters from the shop, He stopped. He thought, "The old man looked at me very carefully. He knows me. Maybe he wants my autograph . " So he turned and walked back into the shop. The old man was still there. "You know me, don't you?" He said to him. "Yeah," the old man said. " I know you are going to buy this shop. " "No, no," the movie star said. "I'm an actor. Did you see my last movie?" "Yeah, it was fantastic," the old man said. "And believe me, if you're not silly, you will buy my shop. "
