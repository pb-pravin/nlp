Can you imagine a life without arms or legs? Now let me introduce a disabled man named Nick for you. Nick, a31-year-old Australian, was born without limbs, so life was not easy for him. At school many students played jokes on him. Because he looked different from everyone else. He was refused to be their friends. So he always felt lonely. However, he faced that bravely. He learned to type on the computer with two toes at the age of six, and he coul even surf and play golf. In college, he achieved great success and was one of the excellent students in the studies. what's more, Nick also encouraged others to work hard for their dreams. Now Nick is one of the most popular speakers in the world.
