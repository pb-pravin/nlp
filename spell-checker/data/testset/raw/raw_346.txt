I had a summer camp with my classmates last year. Early in the morning, we gathered at the bus station. After saying goodbye to our parents, we got on the buses. It took us more than two hours to arrive at the campground . We got off the buses cheerfully. Laughing and shouting, we jumped and ran all over the place. It was the first time for us to be away from parents. Some of us started to feel homesick . However, when the night party and dances began, the homesickness was gone. The next day, everybody rushed to the boating class, hoping to be at the head of the others. At first, my friends and I worked hard, but the boat didn't listen to us and kept going round and round. Then the teacher taught us how to work together. After many tries, we did much better. The swimming class was my favorite. The teacher was a funny man, and during the class he often made us laugh happily. During the week, I learned a lot of new things and made many new friends. I also learned how to take care of myself.
