I'd like to thank you for sending money to Animal Helpers. Your money makes a big difference to a dog. Its name is Sun. Now let me tell you a story. Five years ago I became blind in a car accident. I became interested in nothing because my whole world got black. One day Sun came to me. It was a gift from my best friend Jane. She said Sun could become my eyes. It could help me find my way to a shop, a bus station or anywhere I want to go. I am happy to walk with Sun. Sun brings me new hope in my life. Thank you for changing my life.
