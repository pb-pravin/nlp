When Norman left high school, he went to a college to learn cooking for two years. He enjoyed cooking and was good at creating his own dishes. Then he got a job in the kitchen of a big hotel as an apprentice for four years. Norman soon found that cooking in a hotel was nothing like cooking for his family at home. He needed to work in a hot kitchen for a long time every day. A lot of people couldn't stand it, but Norman enjoyed it. He always made new and unusual cakes on Friday. More and more people visited the hotel on Friday just because of his cakes. The hotel owner soon found out why. When Norman decided to leave the hotel, the hotel owner provided him with more money and the position of head cook. Norman took the position and saved most of the money he made. Finally, he bought his own hotel last year. Then he found he needed a lot more skills than just cooking skills. So he went to an evening school to learn business every Tuesday and Friday. Norman enjoys having his own hotel. But he also enjoys working in the kitchen and thinking up new creations when the hotel is not too busy.
