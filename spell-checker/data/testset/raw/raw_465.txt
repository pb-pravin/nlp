One day the famous American scientist Albert Einstein came across an old friend of his in a street in New York. "Mr. Einstein," said the friend, "It seems that you need to have a new coat. Look how worn-out it is!" "It does not matter," answered Albert Einstein, "Nobody knows me here in New York." Several years later, they met in New York again. Einstein had became a world famous physicist then. But he still wore the same old overcoat. Once more his friend tried to persuade him to buy a new one. "There is no need now." said Einstein. "Everyone here knows me."
