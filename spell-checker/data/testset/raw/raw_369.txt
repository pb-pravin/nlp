Martin Luther King was born in Georgia, the USA. When he was a boy, he sang with other children in the church. Little Martin knew that it was very important to love and be kind to others. Although the church was very important to Martin, he was interested in other things, too. He liked sports very much. He was not tall, but he was very strong. The boys in his town often met at Martin's house for a game of football or basketball. Martin liked school and was a very good student. He went to college at fifteen. At first, he didn't know what he wanted to study. He knew the black people didn't have the same rights as the white people, and he also knew that the black people were not as happy as the white people. He wanted to work for the black people. He wanted to help the poor black people. Later he really became a famous man. He was fighting for human rights all his life. At the age of thirty five, Martin Lather King was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Prize. He became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure. He was murdered on the evening of April 4, 1968.
