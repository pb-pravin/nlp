My name is Cindy. Nick and Andy are my classmates. We all like gifts. We each have our own best gifts. My best gift is a dog. I got it from my cousin on my 12th birthday. I think it's very special because I like animals very much. Nick's best gift is an MP5. His aunt gave it to him on his 8th birthday. He thinks it's very creative. Andy's best gift is a cinema. His father gave it to him on his 9th birthday. He thinks it's very nice because he likes taking photos.
