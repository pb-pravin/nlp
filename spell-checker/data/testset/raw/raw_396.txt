In the past 200 years, the earth's temperature has increased greatly. It's reported that a marked increase in the temperature of about 0.7â„ƒ appeared at the end of last century. Some scientists think mini-umbrellas might reduce the global temperature. Building a single umbrella, which is big enough to cover the whole earth, seems to be impossible. Roger Angel, a scientist from the USA, has carried out research to deal with this problem. He came up with an idea of mini-umbrellas. In fact, each mini-umbrella is made up of two parts, a spaceship and a sunshade . A spaceship weighing about 1g would carry a sunshade that is half a meter long. It would be mostly transparent . That means light can pass it directly to reach the earth, with lands and oceans clearly in view. Pressure from the sunlight would keep the little spaceships in position around the earth at a distance of about 1.5 million kilometers. As a result, sending over 1,000 billion mini-umbrellas into space would reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth. This allows sunlight to be reflected &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; back to space easily, causing the temperature of the earth's ground to fall off. Covering large areas of the earth, mini-umbrellas together could reflect 1.8 percent of sunlight back. In Roger's plan, scientists will send up 800,000 mini-umbrellas at a time, 2- million times in all during ten years. Scientists suggest the earliest launch could be in just 16 years. Not all the scientists agree with the idea. Some suppose there should be easier and much cheaper ways to prevent the earth from getting too hot, such as to slow down the pollution people bring and to reduce the human activities. What ever the result of the argument is, this idea of mini-umbrellas in space is certainly creative.
