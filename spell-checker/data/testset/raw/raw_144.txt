Anna There is a zoo in my neighborhood. I like to spend time there on weekends. I love to watch the monkeys climbing around. The monkeys sometimes fight. They look like my friends and me when we fight! To get there, I usually walk out and turn right on Bridge Road. Then I walk along Bridge Road. The zoo is on the right. John I live near a supermarket. My parents usually shop there. There is a big park across from the supermarket. I often exercise in the park because I love the clean air and sunshine. The best things in life are free! To get to the park, you just have to cross Center Street. Lisa I live in a noisy neighborhood. There is a post office between my house and a clothes store. But my favorite place is the library. It is very quiet and I enÂ­joy reading there. When I read books, time goes quickly! You can get to the library easily. Just go down North Road and turn left. It is across from the park.
