Mr. Brown got up late this morning. He was going to be late for work. It was raining hard and the streets were wet. He drove so fast that he didn't see the red lights. He couldn't stop his car and hit a car. An old man got out of the car and called out angrily, "What are you doing? How can you drive so fast?" "I'm sorry, sir," said Mr. Brown. "I didn't see the lights turn red." Then he brought out a bottle of wine and gave it to the old man. "It's cold today, sir," said Mr. Brown. "Please drink a little, and then you'll get warm." The old man drank some wine and became happy. He asked, "I'm feeling much better now. Why don't you drink any?" " I can't drink anything now, sir," answered Mr. Brown. "I'm waiting for the policeman. Only drunkards cause accidents, you know!"
