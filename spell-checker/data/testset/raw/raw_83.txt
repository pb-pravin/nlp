Mike was a small boy. He didn't like water. When his mother asked him to wash his handsï¼Œ he never really washed them well. He only put his hands in the water for a few seconds and then took them out again. Mike's uncle and aunt lived in another city. One day they came to stay with Mike's parents, and they brought their small son, Ted, with them. Ted was a year younger than Mike, and didn't like water, either. The two boys went out to play. After an hour, Mike looked at Ted's hands and then said, "You are a clean boy!"
