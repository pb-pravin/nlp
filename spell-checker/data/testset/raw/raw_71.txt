Mike is from Canada. Now he works as a waiter in New York. Every August he has one week off for summer holiday. Last summer, he decided to take a trip to San Francisco in the United States. He didn't want to go by plane. He really wanted to see more places of the United States, so he decided to take the train from New York to San Francisco. The train left the station in New York at 10:30 p.m. on Monday. Mike tried to sleep on that night, but he couldn't because he was too excited. He was looking forward to seeing the scene the next day. He thought his trip would be wonderful.
