Man: Generally, if one person is too fat, he is a patient of obesity. With the improvement of living standard, more and more people begin to become fat. There are several reasons for it. On the one hand, there appear all kinds of food with high fat and high calories, and they have become some people's favourite. We call them junk food. On the other hand, too many people are working in office rooms. Sitting for a long time without exercise also contributes to their obesity. Although there are a lot of fitness clubs in every city, many people don't want to go there, because they will spend a lot of money on them. I agree with them.
