My name is Rachel. I have practiced skateboarding for 18 months, and I was the youngest person in a street skateboarding competition last year. Before the new skate park near my home was built this year, the nearest skate park was in a town 10 km away. Some of my older friends went there, but my mom didn't let me go because I wasn't old enough. The only place to skate was on the street, but then I fell and hurt my arm. Also, there were many cars on the street, and some people drove really fast. So I stopped. Now, I can use the new skate park near my home. We have a new skate park in our school too. It keeps us healthy. The school skate park is dangerous for smaller children like my little brother because some students also ride bikes there. They like it because the skate park in the town is much busier. We can also use the skate park in the evenings. I always find schoolwork easy, but skateboarding is hard! After a lot of work, now I'm able to do something like jumping over boxes. Doing things like that really makes me understand the importance of struggling . It is a challenge , but it's something I really enjoy. My older sister works as a skateboard teacher, so one day I'd like to be like her. It's unusual for girls to skate around here, so although I love it, it's a little lonely. I'd like more girls to join in.
