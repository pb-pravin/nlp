Hi, Tony. My friends and I went for a walk through the forest on May 1st. We looked up and saw some trees, about fifty meters tall. Down we saw many monkeys, all busy eating food. I went to the river nearby and then met a young man. He asked me where I came from. When I told him I was from China, he was very interested. We talked for two hours. It was very interesting and he taught me a lot about things here. We had a great lunch of forest fruit. We enjoyed sitting under the trees. Sitting there made us feel free and relaxed. There was heavy rain, but we were dry with all the leaves above us. The forest was like a huge green umbrella. We really had a good time here. I had a wonderful day. Tim.
