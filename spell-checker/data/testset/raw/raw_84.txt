John is ten years old, and he is a very lazy boy. He doesn't study hard at school and tries to do as little work as possible. His father and mother are both doctors and they hope that their son will become one doctor, too, when he grows up. But one day John says to his mother,"I want to be a dustman when I finish school. " His mother is very surprised and asks why. "Because then I only have to work one day a week," John answers. "Only one day a week?" his mother says, "What do you mean? And how do you know?" "Well," John answers, "I know that the dustmen come to our house to work on Thursday, because I only see them on that day. "
