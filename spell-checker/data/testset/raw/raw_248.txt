Have you ever seen a horse with toes ? Millions of years ago, horse had many toes. They had four toes on each front foot. They had three toes on each back foot. The horses were not bigger than cats. These small horses lived in the forest. Their toes helped them run over the soft wet ground. It was very hot in the forest. But the weather changed. It became cold. Many trees could not live in cold weather. The trees died and fell. Open field took the place of the forest. The Sun made the ground dry and hard. Horses began to change, too. They began to get bigger. This took a long time. On the dry, hard land horses needed only their middle toes for running. Their middle toes became hard. After a long time, horse had only one hard toe on each foot. We call this hard toe a hoof .
