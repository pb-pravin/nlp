On September 11, 2001 terrorists attacked the areas of New York City and the Washington D. C. in the United States. Terrorists hijacked four passenger planes in different cities on the same day, so that they could fly them into buildings to finish their attacks. Two of the planes hit the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, which was one of the highest buildings in the world. Both towers were completely taken down in a short time. A third plane hit the Pentagon , and its western side was broken down. The terrorists wanted to attack the White House in Washington D. C. with the fourth plane, but it crashed into a field before it reached there, because the passengers on the plane were fighting against the terrorists at that time. Almost 3,000 people died in the attacks, including the 227 passengers and 19 terrorists on the four planes. It was one of the biggest events in the history of the United States.
