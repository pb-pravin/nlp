Have you ever suddenly felt that someone you knew was in trouble — and was he? Have you ever dreamed something that came true later? Maybe you have ESP. ESP stands for extrasensory perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away. Here's an example. A woman was ironing clothes. Suddenly she screamed. "My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!" Just then, a telegram came. The woman's father died of a heart attack. He died sitting in a chair. There are thousands of stories like this one on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what's behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example — one of hundreds of dreams that have come true. A man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and a carriage came by. The driver said, "There's room for one more." The man felt the driver seemed dead, so he ran away. The next day, when the man was getting on a crowded bus, the bus driver said. "There's room for one more." Then the man saw that the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into flames. Everyone was killed! Some people say stories like these are coincidences . Others, including some scientists, say the ESP is real. From studies of ESP, we may someday learn more about the human mind.
