If you have been to the UK, you will know that one of the biggest problems there. It's the number of cars on the road. It's only a small country, so if you drive in England you are sure to spend time in a traffic jam. Last week I went to London. I was meeting a friend there to go shopping. We both took public transport. My friend lives in Canterbury and the best way to travel there is by train. I live in Oxford and the easiest way to get there is by bus. In fact, there are buses to London every ten minutes, so you don't have to wait long for one. And it is just as quick as driving. We both prefer public transport not only because it's better for the environment but also it's cheaper.
