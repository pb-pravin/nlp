When Mozart was three years old, he joined in his elder sister's lessons. And when he was five, he was able to make up his own music. The Mozart family lived in Austria. The father was a musician, too. He took his clever children through many different countries where they played music for kings and queens and a lot of other people as well. But some people didn't believe that a little boy could write such beautiful music. They thought it must be a trick. They thought his father had written it. So they tried an experiment. They asked Mozart to stay in a room all by himself for a week. Somebody watched the room all the time to be sure that no one talked to him. At the end of the week, he had written a new piece of music for the church choir. Even by working so hard, he couldn't make much money. Often he had to borrow money from his friends to live on. But his music made him happy. For 200 years his music has been making other people happy, too.
