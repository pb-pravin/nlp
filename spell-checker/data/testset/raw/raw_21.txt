Hi, my name is Peter Hand. I’m happy to be here to talk about my pet. Now more and more people like keeping pets and so do I. My pet is a parrot. His name is Harry and I like him very much. Harry is grey with a yellow head. He’s inches long. He’s very friendly. He likes me to pick him up and pat him. He sits on my shoulder when I read or watch TV. He is very cute and clever. He can speak and knows about 0 words. I bought Harry about two years ago when he was six weeks old. I bought a male parrot because male birds are talkers. Female parrots are very quiet and often do not learn to speak. Harry is easy to take care of. He lives in a large cage in my living room. He eats bird seed and chopped vegetables, and his favorite is peas. I put a fresh cup of water in his cage each morning. Harry is by himself most of the day. When I come home, I take him out of his cage and pat him and talk to him. If I want to teach him a new word or phrase, I repeat it over and over. After a few days or a few weeks, he starts to say it. It’s really interesting, isn’t it?
