Some animals can be trained to help humans. For example, specially trained dogs help blind people walk around the town safety. Some kinds of monkeys can be taught things too. They can learn how to help people who can't use their arms or legs. The monkeys pick up the phone when it rings, carry shopping bags and do housework. In the wild, animals and humans are not usually friends, but there are a few interesting examples where they can work together. In Africa, the honeyguide bird works with humans to find food. The bird likes to eat the grubs -a type of insect that lives inside a beehive . It knows how to find beehives but it can't open them and get the grubs. People like to eat honey, but they aren't very good at finding beehives, so the bird and the people help each other. The bird flies to a beehive and the people follow it. When the people open the beehive and take the honey, they give the grubs to the bird. In Laguna in the south of Brazil, fishermen and dolphins work as a team. The ocean isn't very clean, so the fishermen can't see the fish. However, dolphins can find them easily by using sounds. When the dolphins find a large group of fish, they make a noise to tell the fishermen. Then the dolphins push the fish to the beach. The fishermen wait in the water near the beach and catch a lot of fish in their nets. The fishermen's nets make it easier for the dolphins to catch fish too. In Laguna, fishermen and dolphins have been working together for many years. The fishermen teach their children how to work with the dolphins. The dolphins must be happy to help because they teach their babies how to work with the humans!
