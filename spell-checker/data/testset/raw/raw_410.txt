In your school, are you allowed to choose the subjects you want to learn? Of course, the answer is "No" here in China. In America， there is a school trying something new. At a high school in Florida, students will be able to choose their own classes. We all know that some students are better at some subjects than others, some students plan to go on to college, while others will not. At this school， students are able to find subjects they are interested in, and possibly even find the field they would like to go into after graduation . They are allowed to choose a subject like geography, math, a foreign language, or study skills like computer or car repair. Some people think this is a good idea, because it helps students think about what they want to do in the future, and the school helps to give them the knowledge and skills needed to get there. They say that giving the students the chance to choose their own classes makes high school more interesting. Others disagree. They think it will make it difficult for students to discover different possibilities . They point out that fourteen-year-old teenagers are too young to know what they will want to do in the future. What do you think? Would you like to be able to choose your own classes? Many useful changes have been made in education,but seeing the differences in each student is also important. How can we help each student become a better student?
