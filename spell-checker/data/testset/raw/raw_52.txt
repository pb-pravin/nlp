We must go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we will be healthy. Is it true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children of your age need nine hours' sleep every night. If you don't go to bed early, you can not have enough sleep. Then you can't do your work well. Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We must sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep well. When day breaks, we must get up. This is time for exercise. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running, jumping, swimming and playing games are all exercise. It can keep the body strong.
