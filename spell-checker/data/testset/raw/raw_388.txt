Driving a car at a high speed along a highway seems to be fun. But to a London taxi driver, driving is not an easy job. A taxi driver needs to have not only good driving skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the loneliest street to the popular restaurant around. He has to be at the service of all kinds of passengers at all times. A London taxi driver said the following about his job. During the night it is usual for him to stop two or three times for some food. He said, “I never drink when I'm working, or I'd lose my licence.” He often goes home between two and three o'clock in the morning. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, “That’s the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don’t make money, no one is going to give it to you.” London taxi drivers not only “take” but also “give”. Every summer hundreds of poor children from London go for a day to the sea — by taxi! The rides are paid by the taxi drivers. At the sea, they are met by the mayor , and there is a lunch party for the taxi drivers and the children. After a happy day's running around the beaches and visiting the market there, the children go home again by taxi, free of charge of course!
