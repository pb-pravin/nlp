Once I was a little boy. I went shopping with my parents in a shopping mall. We went into a big supermarket. There were many things here. I saw a very beautiful toy. Then I stood in front of it and looked at it for a long time. Then I turned my face to my parents. But I couldn't find my parents. "Where are they?" I said to myself. Then I walked ahead. When I walked for a while, I still couldn't find them, then I began to cry. "Where are you, Tony?" My parents were shouting. "I'm here." I answered. But my parents couldn't hear me because there are too many people in it. Then I began to cry loudly. In the end, my parents found me in the toy section.
