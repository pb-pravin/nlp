Although he died almost 50 years ago, Bruce Lee is still thought to be one of the greatest kung fu performers. Through his hard work, he made Hong Kong kung fu movies popular all over the world. More and more people in the West like his kung fu movies. Born in the U.S.A. in 1940, Lee returned to Hong Kong before his first birthday. As a teenager, he was accepted into one of Hong Kong's most famous middle schools. But he did not put all his heart into his studies. He was more interested in sports, especially kung fu, and hanging out with his friends. In 1959, Lee got into trouble with the police for fighting. His mother was afraid that he would end up in prison , and sent him to the U.S.A. Two years later, he began studying at a university there. While he was still a student, Lee opened his own kung fu school, teaching a kind of new kung fu that he himself developed. He made it different from other kung fu by using a set of quick actions. It also joined together the fighting ways of Japan, Korea and South America to the slow-moving Chinese kung fu. Several of Lee's students were famous actors. They enjoyed his good look and fighting skill, and asked him to start acting in movies. Over the next five years Lee was a little successful in America. His dream was to let his kung fu go into American movies. But the movie makers would not accept his idea, because they thought American people were not interested in kung fu. He decided to show that they were wrong, Lee returned to Hong Kong in 1970. There he made two movies- Fists of Fury and Way of the Dragon , using his kung fu ideas and skills. The movies became hot all over the world, making Lee a world star and great man of kung fu. There followed another one Enter the Dragon , which is thought to be the greatest kung fu movie of all time. Unluckily, however, Lee suddenly died while making his next movie Game of Death. He was only 33 years old.
