One late night, a young man walked into a corner store. There was only a salesgirl in it. Suddenly, the man took out a gun and order her to put all the money into his bag. The salesgirl was frightened and had to do as the man told her. Just when the man was leaving, he saw a bottle of whiskey behind the counter. He loved wine, so he decided to take it, too. At that time, the salesgirl had an idea. She insisted that she wouldn't give it to him because she didn't believe the man was over 21. The man got angry and quickly pulled out his driver's license and showed it. At last, the salesgirl gave him the wine. After the man left, she immediately called the police with the man's name and address. Soon after, the man was caught.
