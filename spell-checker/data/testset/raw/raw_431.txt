I work as a dentist's assistant and people often have “good” reasons why they can't come to see the dentist. When I hear them, I can't help laughing. Roland had an 11 o'clock appointment . He phoned at 12 o'clock and said, “I'm sorry that I missed my appointment. My clock broke.” And then there was Sally who said, “I'm sorry I couldn't come yesterday for my appointment but my pet mouse died.” Colin, who always finds a good excuse not to come for his appointment, rang and told me, “My sister called the police and said I had hit her. They asked me questions for three hours before they decided it was a joke!” One of the best excuses came from 12-ycar-old Tim who came about two hours late for his appointment. He said that an elephant had sat on a car in front of his bus! And this caused such a traffic jam that no cars could move for an hour. 13-year-old Rachel Stuart rang yesterday. This is how that talk went: “Hello, Doctor Bowden's office. How can I help you?” “This is Mrs. Stuart. I’m afraid my daughter Rachel cannot come for her appointment this morning. She has to stay at home because she lost her voice .” “I see. And who am I speaking to, again?” “My mother.”
