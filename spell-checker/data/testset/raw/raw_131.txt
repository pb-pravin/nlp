My dear students, first allow me to congratulate your graduating. It is an important step for your future. It is through hard work that you have made big progress. But, many other years of hard work are also ahead of you. So here are my suggestions. Please take them into your mind. No. 1, keep thinking! Always ask at least 3 questions a day. Those questions may help you grow as yourself. No. 2, stay healthy and happy! It's you who help yourself lead a good life. Nobody else can. No. 3, talk to your future teachers! They're always there waiting for you by heart! No. 4, call your parents! They're the most important people to you in the world. No. 5, cover your drinks. Cover yourself. Do everything in moderation, that means, don't show off yourself too often. The last but not least, don't do anything stupid. But if, or when you do something stupid, don't post pictures about it on QQ or Wechat. Finally, let me conclude to wish you all the best of luck and success in your new life in looking for senior high school studies.
