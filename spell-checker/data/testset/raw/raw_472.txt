In a New York street, a small truck hit a big tree. The truck was full of glasses and they were all broken. The driver came out of the truck and looked at the broken glasses. He was very sad and people in the street felt sorry for him. Then an old man walked over to the driver. He looked at him for a few minutes and said, "My poor boy! I think you must pay a lot for this." "Yes," was the sad answer. "Well, well," said the old man, "hold out your hat, here's some money for you, and I can say that some of these people will give you a helping hand, too." Then he walked away. The driver held out his hat and over a hundred people came and put their money in it. At last, the driver took out a bag and put all the money in it. Then he looked at the people and said, "Well, thank you very much. But you didn't know that the old man is the owner of the truck. I'm driving and making money for him."
