Richard's wife Lily had an accident. Richard's youngest child, John, was at home when it happened. He was playing with his new toy car. Richard had given it to him a week before, for his third birthday. Suddenly John heard her mother calling "Help! Help!" He ran to the kitchen. His mother had burned herself with some hot cooking oil. She was crying and the pan was on fire. John's father, Richard had gone to his office. Both the other children had gone to school. John was too small to help his mother. But he ran to the neighbor's house and asked their neighbor, Jane for help. Jane soon put out the fire and took Lily to the hospital. When John's father came home, John's mother told him what had happened. He was very proud of his son. "When you are a man, you will be just like your father," he said.
