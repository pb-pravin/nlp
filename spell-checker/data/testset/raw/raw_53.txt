Life in the past was different from what it is now. There was only a big old radio in my family house. In the morning, my grandpa listened to the news on it. &nbsp;My father loves football matches very much and he often listened to them on the radio. I often listened to English on it. But now, my grandpa has a new radio. It's small and he can put it in his pocket when he goes out. My father watches his football matches on TV now. It's a big TV. How about me? I have a computer to learn English and download popular songs.
