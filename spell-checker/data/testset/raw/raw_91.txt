There was once a lonely girl. While she was walking in the woods one day, she found two hungry birds. She took them home and put them in a small cage. She took good care of them. The birds grew strong. Every morning they sang a beautiful song for her. One day the girl left the cage door open. The bigger of the two birds flew out. The girl watched as he flew high into the sky. She was afraid that he would fly away and she would never see him again. As he flew close, she caught him in her hand. She held him very tightly. But when she opened her hand, she found the bird was dead! The other bird was pushing against the bars of the cage. She could see how much he wanted to be free. She took him out of the cage and threw him slowly into the air. But the bird just wanted to stretch his wings. He flew around the girl twice and then came to rest on her shoulder. She wasn't worried anymore. She wanted the bird to be happy. The bird sat on the girl's ear and sang the sweetest song she had never heard.
