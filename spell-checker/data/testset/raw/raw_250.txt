Are you interested in country music? I like it very much! It makes me relaxed. Country music is usually about everyday life and feelings of farmers. It's easy to understand. It comes from the southern United States. The life of the countryside can be hard, so the words in country music are often sad. At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s, people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records .When people in the countryside went to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America. John Denver is one of the most famous American country singers. His song Take Me Home, Country Roads is well-known and people still play it today.
