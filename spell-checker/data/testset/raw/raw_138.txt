My name is Sally White. I am a school girl. My school is far from my home. Every day it takes a lot of time to get there. The road is not flat , so I can't go to school by bike. I often get there by bus or on foot. It takes me about thirty minutes to get there by bus and about an hour on foot. I must get up early every morning. I have no time for breakfast at home. I often have something for breakfast on the way or on the bus. I don't want to be late for school, so sometimes I run to school. I am seldom late for school.
