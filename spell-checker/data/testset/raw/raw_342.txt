Today is Saturday. It's sunny and warm. Many children from No.101 Middle School are at the old peopleâ€™s home. Now, they're helping the old people. Look! Li Min and Zhang Ran are cleaning the windows. Ma Lan and Liu Qian are washing clothes. What's Li Na doing over there? Many old people are clapping their hands for her. Oh, she's singing for them. Her song is really beautiful. And where's the American boy, Tom? He likes helping others and he often comes here. Listen! Who's speaking English? It's Tom. He's teaching two old people to speak English. All the children and the old people are very happy. "You can get pleasure when you help others, "says Tom.
