When the Great East Japan Earthquake hit Japan on March 11, 2011, workers in a supermarket in Japan were not running away while the quake was happening. Instead, they were trying to stop the things in the market from falling down. Reporters from NHK, the country's largest TV station, were still working without much worry during the quake while they were in real danger. The 3.11 Earthquake was the most serious one to hit Japan in the country's history. It took away more than 15,000 people's lives. But most Japanese people were calm and not scared at the time of great danger. Their action shows that Japan is the most earthquake-prepared country in the world. This is because Japan has "an earthquake culture". Japanese people have learned how to prepare for earthquakes and what to do during an earthquake when they were very young. Schools in Japan organize earthquake practices every month. Japan also has a good earthquake warning system . Warnings were reported on television, radio and phones nine seconds after experts first knew about the quake on March 11. The warning system is now able to make predictions about earthquakes. But it can usually warn people about 15 seconds before the quake when experts feel its signs. Even 15 seconds can be enough to save people's lives.
