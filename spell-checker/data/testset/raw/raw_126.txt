M: Many Chinese people these days leave their hometown to work in cities. They usually return to their hometowns once or twice a year. Zhao Weilin is one of them. He used to live in a small village in Henan Province. He used to own a farm and sell fruits to make a living. But he didn't think it was enough for his family. Now he lives in a tall building in Dongguan, Guangdong Province. He hasn't been back to his hometown for two years. He has been working in a toy factory for nine years. Last summer his wife and daughter moved there. And he found a primary school for his daughter. He says, "Life is getting better and better now but I miss my hometown very much. I think my hometown is still the place that holds all my childhood memories."
