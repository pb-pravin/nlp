China wants to build its own space station over the next fifteen years, said Wang Yongzhi, one of the famous scientists working on the manned space programme. Wang said he was speaking to 100 high school students from Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao on Sunday. That was reported by Monday's Beijing News. China has spent eighteen billion yuan on its manned space programme in the past eleven years and has made great progress. In October, 2003, Yang Liwei, an astronaut, flew around our earth fourteen times, which is famous all over the world. Wang said, because China does not have enough money now, it does not plan to send an astronaut to the moon, but to send up a satellite that moves around the moon. And China will also use its Changzheng Rocket. Wang, who is now seventy two years old, is an important member of China's manned space programme since 1992. He has made great contribution to China's manned space programme.
