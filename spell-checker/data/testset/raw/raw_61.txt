There was a big forest fire the day before yesterday. A group of travellers had a barbecue in the forest. But they didn't put out the fire completely when they left. This caused the big fire. John, an English teacher, found the fire first. He called the fire station at once. The fire fighters arrived very quickly. The fire was too big and strong. It took the fire fighters two hours to put out the fire. Luckily, no one was hurt in the forest fire. But we must be very careful when we have a barbecue in the forest. We must put out the fire completely after we finish our barbecue. We'd better drop some water on it, too. Never let the dangerous forest fire break again.
