Teenagers can't afford to buy expensive gifts. So what do you do if you want to give gifts to the important peopIe in your life? In fact, you don't have to spend a lot of money on holiday gifts. There are many cheap ways to do that. Here are some make-it-yourself gift ideas to try: To your mum and dad: You can decorate a photo frame, sing a song or write a letter to your mum and dad. You could also draw a picture for them if you like that better. To your teacher: Sometimes students put their pocket money together and buy the teacher a holiday gift, some kids also give individual gifts. You can send a nice card with the words of thanks inside. You might even write down the favourite thing you've learned in the teacher's class this year. It will make the teacher feel happy. To the kids who need a friend: The holidays are a good time to thank about people who are lonely. Maybe there is someone in your cIass who doesn't seem to have many friends. Try to do something for this person. It could be giving a Christmas card or just chatting with him or her. It's a small thing, but it could mean a lot to someone who feels a little shy or sad at school.
