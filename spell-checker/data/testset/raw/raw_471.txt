My name is Kevin. My friends and I went to Amsterdam last summer for a week. We finished our holiday jobs, and we thought we should have a break. We went there by plane. None of us knew the place, so it was a bit of an adventure . And we got completely lost one day. My friend Dave almost fell into a river when we were crossing a bridge. But we finally found the Van Gogh Museum, and we had to wait for two hours there. There were so many people there! While we were waiting there, I met an old friend from school. The world's a small place! We stayed in a travelers' hotel, and met some friendly Italians. The hotel was cheap and clean, and we had to be very tidy. For food, we usually ate in fast food restaurants. But on my birthday, we had a special big meal at an Indonesian restaurant. It's easy to get around the city. A lot of tourists like to rent bikes, but while we were there, we went by bus. We got our tickets from a machine, not from the driver. When we were going to the Vondel park on Friday, two boys didn't buy any tickets, and an inspector caught them. They explained that they were foreigners, but the man didn't accept that.
