Joe and Jack are talking about the year 2020. Joe asks, “What will our world be like in the year 2020?” “I don't know,” says Jack. “What do you think?” “No one knows, but it's interesting to guess，” Joe says. “In the year 2020, everyone will have a pocket computer. The computer will give people the answers to all their problems. We will all have phones in our pocket, too. And we'll be able to talk to our friends all over the world.” “A lot of people wil live and work under the sea. Perhaps there will be big towns, factories and farms under the sea, too.” “Machines will do most of the work, so people will have more holidays，and perhaps they'll work only two or three days a week. They'll be able to fly to the moon by spaceship and spend their holidays there. I'm looking forward to the year 2020. I hope to go to the moon!” “But I hope I'll be able to live under the sea, just like a fish!” says Jack.
