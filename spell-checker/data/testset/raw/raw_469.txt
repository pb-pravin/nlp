Dear Editor , My brother and I argue all the time. It seems that we will argue forever because I don't know how to stop it. What should I do? Cindy Dear Cindy, Next time you feel a fight coming, try your best to stop it. Say to yourself I am not fighting with him. Then think of a better way to solve the problem. Remember if you don't fight with him, he can't fight with you. Editor Dear Editor, I have a friend who hugs me too much. I've tried to stop him, but I just don't know how to stop it. What should I do? John Dear John, Some people are more "huggy" than others, and your friend is one of those people. Try to tell him that you don't want to hug so often. I'm sure he will understand you if you are really good friends. Editor Dear Editor, When I get home from school, I am all alone. My parents don't know, but I'm sad. Should I tell them? Rose Dear Rose, You should tell your parents how you feel. Talk with them about how to solve the problem. Whatever you do, don't keep your feelings to yourself. Editor Dear Editor, When my friends are talking, I always listen. But when I try to talk, no one listens to me. Jason Dear Jason, Your friends probably aren't ignoring youâ€”they just don't notice that you want to say something. Make it easy for them by saying something funny or unusual at first. When they notice that you always say something interesting, they will start to listen to you. Editor
