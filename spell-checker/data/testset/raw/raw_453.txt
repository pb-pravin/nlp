On a cold winter afternoon, Susan was walking home from a supermarket. She was feeling a little tired, as she was carrying her shopping bags. They were so heavy that she wanted to have a rest in the park. She walked towards the park and saw a poor man walking out of the restaurant in front of her. The man was holding a paper bag. He walked to a dustbin and started looking through it. Susan felt sad. She knew this man would take all that he could get, so she went up to him and gave him some fruit. The man looked up in surprise and took what she gave him. A big smile appeared on his face and she felt very happy. Then he said, "Wow! First, someone gave me this sandwich, then the orange juice, and now some delicious fruit. This is my daughter's lucky day. Thank you, girl." Then he went away, singing a song. Just then, Susan knew what the saying "Giving is getting" really meant. Everyone in the world needs help, everyone can give help and everyone will be helped by showing kindness. Giving sometimes doesn't cost much, but it means a lot to the people who you help. Every time Susan has the chance to help others, she will remember the man's happiness at that moment.
