Dear Linda, I've got your letter of December th. I'm very happy to hear that you're doing well. It's been about one month since you left. I'm very glad to hear that your new job is interesting, but I'm sorry to hear that you don't like New York. I think you'll like it better after you make more friends there. Good luck to you! Thank you very much for your invitation, but I'm afraid that I can't go to your Christmas party on December th because my grandparents will come here that day to celebrate Christmas with our family. I'm very sorry! I hope you can come to London to spend the New Year holiday with us. Yours, Mary
