Jerry is 30 years old. He is the manager of a pizza restaurant. He lives in a flat about one mile north of the restaurant. He&nbsp;walks to the restaurant every day. When it rains, he takes a bus. Jerry loves movies very much. When a new one comes out, he will go to the cinema and see the new movie three or four times. Then when it goes to a video, Jerry will buy the video. Jerry has a great collection of over 1,000 videos. Old ones, new ones, English and Chinese -- he loves them all. He can tell you the names of the movies, the directors, the stars and the plots. Jerry can still talk about all the details of the movies. And then he will invite you to his flat to watch them. He is a nice guy.
