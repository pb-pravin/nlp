I'm Lucy. I'm twelve years old. I'm from England. I live in Beijing with my parents now. I'm in Class One, Grade Seven at Beijing International School. My dad is an actor and my mom is my English teacher. Our class will go for a picnic on Sunday morning. I hope it'll be fine. We'll leave at seven o'clock in the morning, and get there in two hours. We'll climb the hill in the morning. A park is next to the hill. At lunch time, we'll have a picnic in the park. We'll play some games. I think we'll have a good time.
