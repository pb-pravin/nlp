Once upon a time, animals were experiencing hunger in a land. A rabbit was walking sadly through the land because of the bad situation of the land. Suddenly a wizard came along and gave him a bag of magical flowers. On his way home, the rabbit met an old sheep and she could hardly walk. The rabbit gave a flower to the sheep. After he did this, the flowers shone with thousands of colors. The old sheep became very healthy. The rabbit went on his way. The same thing happened when he met a duck and then a dog. When the rabbit arrived home, he had only one flower left. At this time his younger brother arrived home, crying with hunger. The rabbit gave his brother the last magical flower. At that moment, the wizard appeared again. He asked the rabbit to go outside and see what he had done. The rabbit went out, and he found the whole land had turned into a green place. There was enough water and food to feed all the animals. And the rabbit felt very happy that he brought happiness to everyone.
