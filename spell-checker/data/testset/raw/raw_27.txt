I have a small room. It is clean and bright. There are two chairs, a desk and a bed in the room. There's a window. I have a computer. It is on the desk. There are some books and a bag on the desk, too. The chairs are near the desk. The bed is near the window. Under the bed there is a ball and my shoes. I have a picture and a photo in my room. The picture is on the wall near the window. There are some big trees and red flowers in the picture. The photo is on the wall near the door. It is a photo of my family. There are four people in my family. They are my grandma, my father, my mother and I. It is a nice photo. I like my room very much.
