Then she has to drive home after work. For several times, Julie has been stopped by some robbers, and had to give money and things to them. She feels frightened alone in her car. So she is in great need of a friend.Soon she got one. His name is Bob. Can you guess who Bob is? It's not a man, it's a doll that looks like a man. He sits in the seat besides her while she drives at night. People in the street think the woman has a man with her, and she feels so safe.
