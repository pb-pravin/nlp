A three-year-old boy saved his mom's life by using her mobile phone to call for help. One morning, Aaron Green, found his mom Cally Wooton lying on the floor of her bedroom, and was not able to wake her up. He immediately turned to his mom`s Blackberry mobile phone on the bed, opened it, found the address book, and called his mom`s grandmother, even though he had never been shown how to use the phone. Little Aaron told her, "Mummy's sick. She`s very ill." The grandmother called Cally's best friend Kara McCoy, who lived nearby. Kara ran to Cally's house. She found Cally was lying on the bedroom floor. She must have fallen off the bed. She was moving but wouldn`t answer. Kara was scared. She didn`t know what to do. She was helpless, so she called the ambulance . Cally was sent to hospital and was found that she had a diabetic seizure . After five days in hospital, Cally was well again. "Aaron has just started learning his ABC." Kara said, "But he was very brave and calm. He did better than me." "If it wasn't for Aaron, I wouldn't be here now. The doctors said I was lucky to be alive." the boy's mother said, "I don`t know how he did it. It is not easy to use that phone. It feels like I must have been watched over by an angel who was guiding him through what to do. I want everyone to know what a superman he is."
