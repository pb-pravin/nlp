What do you do when you see a friend? Do you shake hands? Do you say hello? Do you show that you are happy to see your friend? People say hello in many ways. On one land the people jump up and down when they see a friend. That is their way of saying hello. Some people bow when they meet. It's very popular in Japan. Some rub their own hands together. Other people put one foot up into the air when they meet. On some lands some people kiss the hand of a friend. Others give their friends a big hug. You can say hello in many ways. No one way is the best way. Isn't it fun that they all mean the same thing?
