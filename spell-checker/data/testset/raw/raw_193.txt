People often talk about jobs. But when I tell others what I do for a living, they can hardly believe this job exists . But I'm not joking. I spend my days at work eating chocolate! I taste chocolate from our factory. Every week I receive chocolate from our factory. I have to check it for taste and smell. I also have to taste raw materials we usually use. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. Just beside my office I have a kitchen. I test and taste chocolate I make there, my kitchen is full of machines. It's wonderful to work there during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am in the kitchen. Sometimes I'm out of the country buying the raw materials we need and because I have a young family, that can be difficult. But I love this job. I like to live a different life every day. The question is that many people ask me whether I get bored of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, but I've never felt I didnâ€™t want to eat it. In fact, I'll often go home and eat some more in the morning!
