What is your wish for the New Year? The following is some children's ideas. John: I wish to be a better boy to Mum and listen to her more. I also want to get better grades in school. Kate: My wish is to change my school as there's too much to study in my school. Ann: I wish I could spend more time with Mum. She should stop working at the bank and take up a job at our neighbourhood boy shop. Peter: I wish someone would find a way to help me walk with my only leg, so I can take part in activities and sports that I'm unable to do now. Mary: I wish that I could save all my money, so I could buy presents for my mother, father and sister on their birthdays. Bob: I wish for good health though I'm badly ill. I want to finish high school and take an IT course after. Mark: I wish I could get more money to fix our house. There is a big hole in the wall. Big mice run inside the room.
