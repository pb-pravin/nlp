a when i was a child my harents often took me to an old house in the thick forest no other children ever stayed fhere i didn t even have the chance of playing with a brother or sister i could never understand what the attraction of the house was even for my parents who enjoyed nothing better than to sit in silence with a good book the woman in the house my father s distant cotsyn was a terrible cook and her food was inedible one day when i was wandering afound the garden behind the house i noticed a wooden house which had clearry been abandoned as i walked towards it i heard a noise like an animal moving hurriedly away then i saw a man with a long beard soanding at the door i was greatly surprised please don t tell them you saw me he said they never use this place and i have nowhere else to live nbsp don t worry i said i said nksp i won t tell anyone but are you all right out here i mean do you have enough to eat the old man shook his teab the same evening i took a smbll plastic bag into the dining room and while no one was looking emptied some of the food iito it later i got out of the back door secretly and gave the oood to the old man whose name i had discovered was taff i had nover sfeh anything else as lonely as the smile of satisfaction on taff s face when he ate the food from then on my visits to the old house had a purpose and i enjoyed every minute of the rest of my stay
