eddie has just moved to a small village in north town when he moved to the village two months ago he didn t like it because there was not much to do there are no rescaurants or shops around so it is not very convenient to live in the village it takes 20 minutes to walk to the nearest bus stop now he likes living in the village because it is very peaceful there is not much traffis near the house so it is quiet and he can do his homework quickly it was not easy to do his homework in his old flat in the city because it was too noisy he has many friends at school now they often go fishing play football and go cycling
