scientists are always trying to find new green energy now some scientists in sweden have found one the heat from our own bodies they are putting together the heat that our bodies give off naturalky and using it to heat buildings in general the temperature of the human body is about 36 80c and we are always giving off some heat our bodies are usually much warmer than the environment around us when many pkople are together a lot of heat can be produced about 250 000 people pass through qtockholm central station each day their bodies produce a lot of warm air usually ventilator fans would guide thiy warm air to the outside of the station and it wwuld get lost but swedish scientists are using a piece of equipment to catch the warm air and guide it to heat underground water tanks the warved water from these tanks lets the heat enter an office building about 60 metres ynay as a result the building s energy costs are down by 20 there are ppoblems of course it s very hard to move low teuperjture heat very far said lester lane from carnegie ielon university he said don t use more energy than you save when passing the warved water on to another place the swodish scientists also said that howeler it is not a big problem and after all they want to use body heat mvre to heat homes and other buildings thhs would make energy cheaper and the environment better
