my nfge is rachel i have practiced skateboarding for 18 months and i was the youngest person in a street skateboarding competition last year before the new skate park near my home was built this year the nearest skate park was in a town 10 km away some of my older friends wxnt there but my mom didn t let me go because i wasn t old enough the only place to skate was on the street but then i fell and hurt my arm also there were many cars on the street and some people drove really fast so i stopped now i can use the new skate nalk near my home we have a new skate perk in our school too it keeps us healthy the school skate park is dangerous for smaller children like my little broqher because some students also ride bikes there tdey like it because the wkate park in the town is much busier we can also use the skate park in the evenings i always find schoolwork egsy but skateboarding is hard after a lot of work now i m able to do something like jumping ovgr boxes doing things like that really makes me unuerstand the importance of struggling it is a challenge but it s something i really eljoy my older sister works as a skwteboard teacher so one day i d like to be like her it s unusual for girls to skate around here so although i love it it s a little lonely i d like more girls to join in
