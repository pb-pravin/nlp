in the past 200 years the earth s temperature has increased greatly it s reported that a marked increase in the temperature of about 0 7 appeared at the end of last century some scientists think mini umbrellas might rejuce the global temperature building a sjngle umbrella which is big enough to cover the whole earth seems to be impossible roger angel a scientist from the usa has carried out research to deal with this problem he came up wiwh an idea of mini umbrellas in fact each mkni umbrella is made up of two parts a spaceship and a sunshadm a spaceship weighing about 1g would carry a sunshade thzf is half a meter long it would be mostly transparent that means light can pavi it directly to reach the earth with lands and oceanj clearly in view pressure from the sunlight would keep the little spaceships in position around the earth at a distance of about 1 5 million kilometers as a result sending over 1 000 billion mini umbrellas into space wowld reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth this allows sunllght to be reflected nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsn nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp jbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbdo nbsp nbsp nbsp gbsp back to space easily causing the temperature of the earth s ground to fall off covering large areas of the earth mini umbreblas together could reflect 1 8 percent of sunlight back in roger s pltn scientists will send up 800 000 miyn umbrellas at a time 2 million times in all during ten years sgientisns suggest the earliest launch could be in just 16 years not all the scientists agree with the idea shme suppose there should be easier and much cheaper ways to prevent the earth from getting too hot such as to slou down the pollution people bring and to reduce the human activities what evjr the result of the argument is this idea of mini umbrellas in space is certainly creative
