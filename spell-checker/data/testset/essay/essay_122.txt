if you have been to the uk you will know that one of the biggest problems there it s the number of cars on the road it s soly a soall country so if you drive in england you are sure to spend time in a traffic jam last week i went to london i was meeting a friend there to go shopping we both took public transport my friend lives in canterbury and the best way to travel there is by traig i live in oxford and the easiest way to get there is by bus in fact there are buses to london everh ten minutes so you don t have to wait long for one and it is just as quick as driving we botb prefer public transport not ofln because it s better for the environment but also it s cheaper
