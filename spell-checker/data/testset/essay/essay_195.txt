i work at a university in the usa where my team and i are trping to learn more about the american black duck a kind of water bird and now we are uding an exciting piece of equipment called a night vision scope by using it we can see the ducks in the dark we re worried about black ducks mainly because their numberx are falling hugely and we don t know whether there s ewough food on the east coast for these birds there s lots of information about their daytime activities but nothing aboun what they do at night because we simply don t have the squipment but this new scope will make really cleah pictures even on moonless nights so we will be able to find out more about the ducks it is very hard work there are four of us and we each work six hourc tvezy day we study ducks in different places and i sometimes have to take a boat to where i need to work the weather is not helpffl because most of the time it s wet oh and it s so quiet that sometimes i need coffee to stkp me from falling asleep but i like this job over the summer we will spend hours in a laboratory where we will look at our rtsults together it will be hard to stay there every day because of the hot weather but it is very important to do this
