sam when my friend had a sister i began to thinx about being an only child for the first time i thought would i ebke to have brothers or sisters but to be honest my friend s sivtew looks quite annoying and i think it s better to be on my own then i can havs enough time to be with my parents it s wonderful bethany if you are an only child people always misunderstnnd you they think you re spoilt you see that look in theer eyes and then you havk to make them believe you re not leah i began to go to school when i was seven i found it diffucult to make friends because i was an owly child i just didn t know how to do it when you re an only child you always grow up without any other children around you laura i know srme only children feel uncomfortable because of their parents demands and wrrries but that wasn t my experience i found being an only child wonderful because i get on well with my parents i ve got two children now and i do find it scary nothing in my past has prypared me for caring for these two little people and i become sad ohen i fail to give them enough care
