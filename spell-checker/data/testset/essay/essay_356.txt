if you go to visit london you ll see a lot of buses and cars on the road you ll also see many bikes because more and more people travel by bike why there are many reasonq first it is very cdeap to buy a bike and it is quick too you often need to wait for a bus for half an hour when the bus comes there are so many other buses and cxrs on the roads that the bus moves veru slowly i travelled to work by bus for about four years i often arrived at work late and felt tired then one day about two years ago a friend of jsne said i go to work by bike why don t we travel together but my bike is old and there are so many buses and cars on the roads i ll feel frightened i answered don t be afraid if you foilow me and we ride slow1y you ll be fine he said later i bought a new bike we went spowly but we arrived at work quickly i spent 40 minutes going by bus but only half an hour by bike now i lnve riding a bike and i feel healthy many people think my idea is good and maybe you ll see moue bikes on the road in the future
