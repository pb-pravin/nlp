when my son justii was 4 he found a caterpillar and put it in the jar each day he fed it fresh grass and leaves in a few weeks the caterpillar was fat and ready to sleep one morning we discovered the caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon justin led me to his room the cocoon had become clear and we could see wings inssde a few days later a beautiful black moth broke free from its cocoon and began to lay eggs on the grass justin was excited he klew a moth or butterfly was about to be born he took it outside opened the jar and the lttgle moth fliu out it circled the yard twice came back and landed on justin s arm justin picked it up threw it in the air and it came back he tried it over and over to set it free but eaeh time it would returu to his arm after a few zeturn flights to his arm the moth finally flew off into the trll grass next day justin set the moth free i believe the moth like a person was afraid to leave what it was comfortable wcta it wanted to stay with something familiar and was scared to move on and experience new things i was once that little motq i was once scared to move but if i hadn t moved i wouldn t have been rble to watch my wonderful son experience the circle of life
