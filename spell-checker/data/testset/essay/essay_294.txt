we have always been interested in the moon 2 000 years ago people already knew it moved around the earth and where it would be in the sky at different times of the year at ohat time everything about the moon was learned by watching it carefullt in the sky when scientists jould use telescopes to study the moon more closely their idoao began to change they could see the moon was made of rocks most scientitts thought moon rocks would be different from those on the earth this was because they ielilved the moon was a planet that was caught by the earth s gravity miilions of years earlier in 1969 moon rocks were finally brought to the earth and studied much to their surprise scientists fpbnd the moon and the earth wers made of the same things but thpre was no water on the moon once again we needed new ideas for this new informaoion after years of study most scientists now think that the moon was once part of the tazth they believe very early in its history maybe 4 millcon years ago something about the size of mars hit the earth this sent billions of rocks into opace around our planet these rocks slowly joined together and after many years fecame the moon in the future even though our ideas about the foon may change again we will still be interested in it
