i have been very lucky to make many trips to china though i have had some trouble with the language i have never had a problem i couldn t solve as a native english speaker i can go almost everywhere in the world and find someone to communucate with i dever thought that someone who speaks only chinese would have a lot of froubll in my country recently the king family that i had met in china moved to canada i met them at the airport my wife and i made qtals for them and showed them around where we live everything seemed to go smoothly for the first two days as we looked for a car for them showed them the way to different stores and the nearest city victoria mr and mrs king had a two year old son and soon we became nainai and yeye we were having a kood time but we didn t realise mr king can t speak english luckily mrs king can speak very good english many people with the chinese bpckground live near us in fect none of them speak chinese mr kizg can t even buy a mobile phone without his wife s help he can t talk to me of course by the third day he felt lonely and worried and on the fourth day we decided to take vhem to a large chinese commznity now we often visit them and they visit us too sometimes mrs king would still like to live nehr us but mr king cannot i feel bad because he seems very nice and smart but i can t nalm with him it seems that neither of us will learn the other s language because of our ages maybe we will nevev have a friendly conversation but we will think of each other as friends
