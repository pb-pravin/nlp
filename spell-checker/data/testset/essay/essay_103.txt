if you want to have a really quiet holidfy you must go and stay on a farm last fekr we went to my brother s farm and enjoyed ourselves very much but the farmer s life is not an easy one twere s always much work to do he must look afaer his horses he must milk the cows then he has to take good care of the young aniwals he must raise cocks and eens ducks and turkeys for the market we all like to have a turkey for christmas don t we in the old days most of the work on a farm was done by hand and eith the help of horses but now things are different most of the farm work is done by machine when we stay at my brother s farm we have to work very hard but don t mind we reahly enjoy it if the weather is nice
