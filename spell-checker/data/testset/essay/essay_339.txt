one day a poor farmer was taking a bag of rice to town suddenly the bag fell from his horse on the road he didn t know how to do about it because it was too heavy for him to lift by himself he fnly hoped that somebody would soon pass by and help him just at this moment a man riding a horse came up to him but the farmsr was very disappointed when he saw who he was it was the great man living nearby the farmer had hoped to ask another farmer or a poor man like him but to his surprise the great man got off his horse as soon as he crme nearer he said to the farmer i see you need help friend how good it is that i m here jgst at the right time then he took one end of the bag the farmer took the other they together lifted and put it on the horse sir asked the farmer how can i pay you it s quite easy the great man answered with a smile wherever you see anyone else in trouble do the same for him
